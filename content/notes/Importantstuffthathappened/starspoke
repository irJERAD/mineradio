One night in San Diego I met a star. At the airport waiting as a lyft driver I spoke to what looked like a star. This twinkling red orange star grabbed my attention.

I looked up to the star and tried to think about what it was saying. What did this twinkling pattern say. Introducing myself I heard,
"We know"
"We are leaving"
"The US blew it"

Then a girl spoke up. She had left but did not find anyone she liked. We spoke for a little then she jumped down. She heard my critical voices:
"He smokes"
"He's bad"
"blah blah"

she questioned me but waited a min before offering me a cup of her special water. We shared the cup then were followed by an onlooker.  
He seemed to be lurking and made one thing clear, he was interested in this missy. After blowing him off for a date - perhaps to make him jealous - we carried on to our journey.
We never hooked up or anything but made life long partnership. She took me places I could have never imagined an would have never thought possible. Her stories made our legends seem so thin and laking in devotion.
