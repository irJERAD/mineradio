Another view on the transdimensional link between me and another world. They are human and from earth very similar to my timeline as well; rather than the Hexigods of an advanced species.
The singularity is new and a few ‘natural’ humans are selected to remain alive in the ‘real world’ or more real of the worlds.

Obstacles:
Computing Reality: real world, believable simulations are difficult. Computing as many possible states for the environment and stimulus provided to a user / being.
Solution:
Use a human processing unit. Using a human’s mind in the logic of the computer system. 
The human mind has instinct to guide expectations.
Experience to guide prediction.

Computer in the sky: 
Use the world in the logic of a simulated reality.
What better way to predict, compute, simulate the motion of a tree in the wind than using an actual tree. The biology has natural signals (perhaps they are read through a similar radar type medium as the mind’s inner voice).
