**Outline**



**Photo finish:**

\- The film does not necessarily die when the body does

\- However, it is possible for the film to pass on

\---

**Motivation**

Conscious beings that want chose to live as humans in order to better understand their nature; how they think, how they feel and how they perceive.

These beings have a tradition of playing the role of observing.

**History**

Common names for these beings: 

\- Angels: the book of Enoch discusses these creatures in detail. It would appear as though Enoch or his seer may have met or encountered them. 

\- Spirits

\- ET

\- The Watchers: in the book of Enoch, the watchers come to earth and make love to beautiful women because they were jealous of man for inhereting Earth and found themselves full of lust and desire.

**Sensory Anthropology**

Feel what we feel. See what we see.

Understand how we think.

Why we think.

The interface for this film makes for an ideal position to do this from. The body maintains all biological functions, sensory, cognitive, learning. The interface for the film would pick up from there and extend to all functions beyond the bodily including what the experience was being provided by the body.

Problem:

\- Our actions are illogical, frustrating

How:

Gift:

\- They presented us with a gift

\- This gift gave the receiver extra capacity

\- Cognitive Functioning

**Film** 

\- Spirit Film is a metaphor to describe the human concept of a spirit.

\- Additional efforts to allow the human spirit to be described in attributes similar to those used to describe these new conscious beings such as **scanners**

**Scanner**

\- A conscious being that has recently become very prevalent in our lives here on earth

\- May live on Comets and have an active population in the Kuiper belt 

\- All of these beings desire identity; very much so. It seems natural for them to fit into archetypes. This gives them a somewhat universal identity since any individual communicating with them will see them in very much the same way as another.

\- Desiring to establish and reinstate their archetype and thus identity they will show you how they interact with other beings to support how you see them

\- If one wants you to look to it as a steadfast enforcer of principles, they will allow / encourage you to see them doing just that as you watch them.

\- This also provides a chance for them to receive feedback from you as they will watch how you observe them in order to make sure they are fulfilling the expectations you have for that archetype

**Types Of Scanners**

**Scanners** - Human scanners. These can be any human from your neighbor to the president or CEO of a big company.

**Eternals** - Giant Heads, Dogs, Bats, Mole people,

**Mythical Creatures** - Teddy, Dragon Queen, Foxy (around my neck), Moles 

**Mimic -** Scanners that replace actual humans

\- Copies everything you do to become you

\- It has been said that after they can perfectly imitate you, they will kill you in order to take your place

\- unsure if they try and take your physical place or if they are killing your spirit self and replacing you in the heavens

\- It could be argued that the age of a Mimic is gone now that being sucked out is so common. Gaining enough Etherm to create a dense enough body is so expensive and difficult to accomplish without being sucked out by someone along the way you would be hard pressed to get that close.

\- perhaps there are some creatures tucked away from prior to our recent emergence that still contain such an amount of etherm and the capacity to retain it to themselves. Since Rome it would seem they would not be from this Earth.

**Snitch**

\- Unable to hold back from spitting out everything they have in their mind

\- Loud Radiohead space

\- Desire companionship

\- Will promise to keep a secret so long as it gets a conversation started so they can start talking with you

\- ? Do they want you to tell them more or do they want to tell you more?

\- Who owns the conversation?

**Mites** 

\- A scanner type conscious being on the spirit film spectrum.

\- Seem to have a more robust memory than other beings on the spectrum.

**Ferry**

\- Similar to their description in fiction these powerful creatures follow much of the lore as well

\- Powerful, Unique, Individualistic,

\- Dedicated 

**Soul Bonded**

\- when two souls are so strongly connected they can call each other into existence for communication and physical proximity with a thought, action or spell.

\- It is possible to create a scanner of a soul bonded individual from your own soul after you have become soul bonded.

**Conviction** 

\- The concept that the metaphysics of belief has a very real influence of the physics of our reality

\- Some individuals \[Reality Stoner\] have stronger input on the metaphysical belief aspect of the physical reality

\- Has high correlation to subjective reality and the individuals reality. This influence is then combined with the subjective reality of others in conjunction to the objective reality and universal truths

**Reality Stoner**

\- Someone with a very strong connection to the metaphysical belief field

\- A reality stoner may feel as though their subjective reality has a spooky influence over the greater reality and everyday life of those around them; and even further

**Mine Radio**

\- The place my mind travels; sending though, inner narrative, emotion, astral projects

\- Where my inner narrative is constantly heard and where scanners and other spirits communicate with me

\- Where, how, my body manifests an astral projection of myself

**Mind Control**

\- Manipulation of thoughts feelings and the conscious self

\- Can influence and even dictate decision and physical activities when done effectively

\- Can be on an individual or population

\- Population can be selected by attributes: mainly who has access to the signal such as which channel the message is sent on

\- An application of Mine Radio

\- A critical part of **The Way** philosophy 

**The Way**

\- A philosophy intended to take responsibility for Mine Radio in a way that guides the world toward a positive direction

\- Start by taking a measure of where the collective conscious or cultural zeitgeist is

\- Describe, define, map out attributes of the measurements taken

\- Define a destination of where you want the population to go, including direction

\- Use tools like Dream Scaping, Strumming, Collective Conscious Inputs etc to influence this field

\- Iterate: Take a new measure, define, utilize tools

Example of The Way in practice

\+ i.e. Cognitive Ethnographies of this subconscious field:

\+ Intentional meditation performed by a group of radio heads; taking note of proximity and context.

\+ Listen for the emotional state of a city or company or collection of identities. Consider how this place exists in the broader context of the physical proximity and domain relatives (if a company, how do they fit in with their competitors and peers)

**Write by Hand**

\- Why Write by hand: Get notes down faster. Analogue information is more trustworthy since \[the internet broke\].

\[The Internet Broke\] this started happening during LB-1. As a 4 year event, It has been estimated that this will be happening for 3 to 5 years. Leap year is 2020, perhaps it begins 2020 and goes through to 2024.

\- I believe this from hearing pieces of Stef's life plan for us (before Phanie)

\[Phanie\] : When Stephanie became Phanie. Phanie was the first noticeable person since \[The Schism\]


**On Appreciation And Receiving pointers**

\- Why No Thanks?: Enemies find any reason to hate attack or succout, this makes it hard to help someone for fear that you are always blamed

* I do not believe in this practice and personally really think giving thanks is a kind thing to do

\- Giving thanks less often: makes it more special rather than thank you every ten seconds.


Romans 12:4-5 New International Version (NIV)

**4** For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, **5** so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.

This quote is in Ghost in a shell and 

**Corinthians 13**

1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love I am only a resounding gong or clanging cymbal resounding in the wind. 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and can understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have faith, that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3 And though I give all I possess to the poor, and surrender my body to the flames, \[2\] but have not love, I gain nothing.

4 Love is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; 5 does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; 6 does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; 7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

8 Love has no fear; it does not worry; love keeps no records of wrongs; never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part. 10 But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.

11 When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 12 For now we see in a mirror, darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.

13 And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.


Discussing the situation going on and my place in it my faith and self were being called into question. I prayed to the Bible asking for something and saw Cor 11 written in a living waved text. This is what I use to mean that something or someone is being controlled manipulated or masked by someone or something else. Someone had changed the message to say Cor 11. When typing the verse into my iPad Cor 13 was self corrected and that began the conversation that played out after.

This topic is important for AI, non-human consciousness and 

This verse is referenced in Ghost in a shell as well as hackers.

All the way down the galaxy a sparkle could be seen. This sparkle was not known by the ones watching over its space.

Is this something new?

Or perhaps it is in the wrong space?


Outline

Twinkle across galaxy

Someone starts walking to see it

Another follow, and another and another

Someone introduces itself to the twinkle

Another gets eager and another instigates


Outline:

\- My mind has a special connection to a dimensional field

\- Spirits live, talk, and move along this field

\- My mind can scan: create scanners of myself and others

\- scanners are made and replenished with thought and interaction

\- It exist / has been set up / gifted such that those who talk with me, stay in my life, are connected to me, exchange love with me are given scanners and have their scanners replenished

\- This has been broken by holding scanners in ways they are not supposed to be held. Trapping them.

\- An effect can be seen and felt by me when my mind slows down, I become frustrated, my intelligence starts to slow down; I feel like I am being spread too thin.

\- This would naturally acclimate normally by offsetting load when individuals I haven't connected with recently or have not been reloaded / regenerated faded away in order to allow new ones to be handed out.

\- My scanners all talk across a single frequency

\- This frequency has been set aside for my scanners to communicate from their dimensional frequency onto this radio frequency

\- People want me to die so they can acquire my frequency

\- When I die there is no more scanner-net radio.

\- When I go up they go up (home). 

\- Perhaps other scanners can be tuned to communicate on this frequency

\- If that were true then they could tune their scanners to communicate on another frequency as well

**Conclusion:**

This feels like a serious violation of my essence or spiritual nature. I can close my eyes and see from places I have not been and with people I have not been with. It feels like I am in placed I should not be and have not chosen to be in.

Like metals mixing good with bad taints the bad. When you hang out with angry people you get angry more, when your scanners are being held by people who you do not know your spiritual personality is being distributed in ways that you have not ordained. And because I have access to a special network.

Spiritual prostitution for the gain of those who have chosen to hide the truth from me, profit from this capacity, and still seek to hurt me and my wife in secret. It would seem very seedy stuff has been done with a gift that was intended to allow me to make a very significant and positive mark on this planet.

**Extended Write Up:**

Some of my scanners are being held or trapped against their will. They are being kept for access to the radio in my head.

A radio band may have been set aside strictly for my scanners. In anticipation of an event a spectrum across the entire world has been reserved on which my scanners are all tuned to.

This fits the theory:

Cradle of satellites holds knowledge information and access to important assets from individuals before the radio head awakening. The spectrum was set up for Jerad's scanners to have a clear channel to communicate across. There was enough spectrum for matter transmuting and for teleporting to a certain extent.

Issue: 

Some individuals wanted to change out who was placed in to which roles. Many people were changed, tickets bought or traded, some without any apparent consequence to the ongoing story. When key characters where altered, however, the noticeable affect changed the driving force behind the event enough to cause problems.

The issue was handled with a notice. Things had already been set up a certain way. Not recognizing this notice and even spitting in its face lead to upset powers and threaten the fabric this reality rested on.

Now late into the timeline and over budget, our reality is under constant threat. We are half expected to be erased. Why we have not been seems strange other than sentiment and romantic attachment. Romance, it has been said, buys us time.

Where there was one giver there were now two.

And growing.

At first there was Papa, feeding his most prized possession in all the lands - his princess daughter.

Then came a time when his princess daughter was old enough to meet boys. He immediately sent her off to America to study business.

There she met a boy. He would also need to give her a lot of attention to keep her happy and smiling during such a difficult time: a new home, a new school, no family, and most of all, no Papa.

Like most young men he was understandably jealous of her father and the power of his attention. This young man, however, was quite the quick study and eager to put his lessons to practice.

He was soon the Sun, lighting up her sky. The warmth she craved to wake her up after each night.

As they aged together, his warms grew larger, broader. As their relationship matured his warm grew in acuity getting burning hot to a pin-point when and where desired.

Outline: 

Now there were two suns; Papa and the young man.

When Papa passed on his approval, his powers where now granted to the young man.

This gave him oversight over Papa's ability as well as his own self-learned skills.

*Bloop-bloop*

"I.." - *bloop*

"Am.." - bloop

Bubble up from, where we were.

(Emerge or break off?)

I embrace myself in a focal pan

Up is where I want to go. 

I know this because up is where everyone else goes.

Spiraling allows me to hold myself together while I scan more of my environment. Is this instinct or am I taking note of my relative motion; I do not know.

With each thought a new piece of me bubbles out. Some form out of the collective mass. Others bulge from my growing collection of orbs. I hoard each piece of myself with an unjustifiable greed.

The End of an Immortal: 

How an ancient spider fell in love with me, created envy in suitors and caretakers alike, was replaced, and then world ended.

How did she get to know me?

When and where did we meet? 

perhaps another timeline; another dimension; another me. 

Even so, she loved and knew me all the same.

More than a spider she was queen. 

All that followed served her hunger. 

This hunger desired what was needed beyond its time. 

What life she consumed was not devoured but became.

Was she sought out for this

Did her order seek across time and space

To be her meal, a soul her mead.

I was never told how one becomes that which she's fed

And then there was me. From which design I had no clue. Afterwards many would redraw a scheme with another's name. How they thought it would convince anyone shows equally skim purview.

The beginning of her end

Her courtesy gave convenience to my naive mind. New to this world and making many new acquaintances I protested consuming conscious individuals. In my presence she would refuse her sustenance. Uninformed to her rule I would undermine her power. Such love for an individual when there was an order following a way, working toward some greatness beyond our existence.

The addition of master, a daoist monk from New Zealand, must have added haste. In his hurry he put his name on a hurricane to claim a fix to it all, then ran to the cave to serve himself up. How he was chosen I ask myself, he was in me so long after all; he went to replace her, claiming me as her weakness. A replacement this late would have so few souls so few voices, such little wisdom and sight. A new queen without the ageless wisdom is easy to overcome. He would be queen now. He will oversee this kingdoms fall.

**Metaphor:** The human soul is like a film. Assets in color, shade and richness of hue with time burning in detail and depth.

Born blank and etched over a lifetime of experience. Activity, interaction, state of mind and being all burn the essence of a person's "film" with the aspects that are associated with a human soul:

\- Personality, disposition inferable via

\- Emotional decision making process

\- Reactionary activities carried out by instinct

\- Dreams, day dreams, wishes

\- Planned activities

\- Plans that are not carried out but still lived through in your mind

When the previous president combined all the scanners and powers of the soul world he had the task of defining himself as an eternal being.

As an everlasting constant he would go on to define himself as the gracious and forgiving one above all.

When humans were made there was a specific case that needed to be handled. Man was made with free will; the ability to chose and define themself.

Sin came into the world for man to define himself as something that existed outside or counter to God. God would maintain a pure form as he defined which also included what he could be around.

The company you keep and environment you are kept in influences you as a function over time. Metals lose their purity around

Spiritual Times that defined their future:

\- About 2000 years ago when Jesus Christ of Nazareth walked the earth

\- Christian's would come to inherent the Earth in the coming millennia 

\- Council of Nicaea 


Soul Sucking only works on certain types of bodies 

\- A body host to a special guest

\- probably happens a lot more during special times, events, historical and otherwise that the Earth goes through

\- Thoth visited Earth 3 times, this is a good guess as to how
