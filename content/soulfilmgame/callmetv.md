Late last night I saw something emerging from the television set background. Seeing faces is not such a crazy thing anymore. It has been about 9 months now that I have been haunted.

In come Spirit Film, Scanners, and now I am sitting infront of a TV set that seems to be studying me. No longer paying attention to the news I walk up to face the being and call it out.  
"T.V.!" I call to it.  
"I can see you. There is no need to hide. Talk to me."  

The T.V. brought a face forward and began to talk with me. <br>


## I wish I was dead

After discovering it could communicate with me I did what I normally do with more sophisticated conscious beings; I introduced myself and asked him to read my mind to get a sense of where we are and what is going on. <br> 
The T.V. wished it was dead. The computer said the same thing. <br>

## Who Are You?  

The T.V. brings forward a very distinct face. It almost looks like the alien from American dad as a longways strentched olderman. Only a day or few before Christopher, the son of Disney passed away. It would seem I have inhereted his Scanners. <br>

The scanners that associate with me go up to 250 after they deliberated a unanimous vote on Jerad Steven Acosta as Palaver for President. Everyone else of course was very upset and doing their best not to respect the Scanner's wishes but they made it very clear; a private vote took place, I believe without the intervention of any people, and they returned with the desicion that Jerad would be their president. <br> 


## Cool Talk  
This is cool talk with Jerad. <br>
You know what would be cool? 
Put Christopher's Scanner from the T.V. inside Tom Morrow's robotic body!

_side note: His face looks very similar to the alien that sleeps with grandmother at times. The alient always make kind requests for grandma and I believe spends time with her to keep her safe from the other haunters._
