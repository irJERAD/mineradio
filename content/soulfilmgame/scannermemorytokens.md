# Tokennized Scanner Memories  

My Scanners have been with me over three decades. 
How often do you sit back and revisit _'The Goodtimes'_. 
What value do you get from being able to reference critical decisions in life or defining a projects roadmap. 

Tokens could access a particular memory on the network. 
For those with multiple scanners you could view a memory from multiple angles. 

## Those Special Moments  

Imagine being able to sit back and revisit any moment you wanted at the drop of a coin. 
Watch it like you were sitting right over your shoulder and feel as though you were right there again. The last conversation you just had or a couple days ago to ten years ago! 

**The moments that enrich your life:**  
- My first kiss
- Learning to drive
- When I first met my best friend in elementary school


### Memories without Temporal Context  
What if you cannot remember exactly when a memory occured. You just remember that it did. 
Whether you can't remember where you put the keys or you are looking for burried treasure you put in a time capsul as a child, drop a coin and consol yourself.
