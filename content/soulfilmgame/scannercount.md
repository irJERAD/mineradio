Approximate Scanner Count:

Disney's Son - 250
Man in the TV that watched grandma while she watched TV.  
Came to me just befor e his publicly announced death. Then on the night of his announced death, he asked me to pray for him asking God for a place in heaven for him and asking me for a placce in my heart.  
He then gave me his 250 scanners.  
He also saw the boy with black hair and white skin that had been a powerful enemy, who from his satalite would threaten the world with his missle codes. We went through many challenges but worked it out most times. The man in the TV extended a cable and vaporized the kid, eliminated him from my obstacles - Temporarily.  

Martians - 414 to 800 unsure of official count and I was not able to hold them all in my body. I was also being constantly ripped off.  
The martians were a very reliable crew. They had many minds but worked and concluded as a single.  
There leader, Green Small grew very close to my heart and manned the radio controller with excellent skill and honor.  

Squids from space - a couple  
These were very large scanners and were less interested in me as they were in becoming existing people in my neighborhood.

Bat people - 1 puck and a great friend in a friends daughter

Bats - 1 on my nose

Bats that grew up - 15 - 30 I raised on my spine.  

Bee - 1 large bee on my face  

Bees - 1 Treasure Chest opened and awarded to me
