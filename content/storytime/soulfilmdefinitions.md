Film 
- Spirit Film is a metaphor to describe the human concept of a spirit.
- Additional efforts to allow the human spirit to be described in attributes similar to those used to describe these new conscious beings such as scanners

Scanner 
- A conscious being that has recently become very prevalent in our lives here on earth.
- May live on Comets and have an active population in the Kuiper belt 

Types Of Scanners
- All of these beings desire identity; very much so. It seems natural for them to fit into archetypes. This gives them a somewhat universal identity since any individual communicating with them will see them in very much the same way as another.
- Desiring to establish and reinstate their archetype and thus identity they will show you how they interact with other beings to support how you see them
	- If one wants you to look to it as a steadfast enforcer of principles, they will allow / encourage you to see them doing just that as you watch them.
		- This also provides a chance for them to receive feedback from you as they will watch how you observe them in order to make sure they are fulfilling the expectations you have for that archetype
Mimic
- Copies everything you do to become you
- It has been said that after they can perfectly imitate you, they will kill you in order to take your place
	- unsure if they try and take your physical place or if they are killing your spirit self and replacing you in the heavens

Snitch
- Unable to hold back from spitting out everything they have in their mind
- Loud Radiohead space
- Desire companionship
- Will promise to keep a secret so long as it gets a conversation started so they can start talking with you
- ? Do they want you to tell them more or do they want to tell you more?
	- Who owns the conversation?

Mites 
- A scanner type conscious being on the spirit film spectrum.
- Seem to have a more robust memory than other beings on the spectrum.

Ferry
- Similar to their description in fiction these powerful creatures follow much of the lore as well
- Powerful, Unique, Individualistic,
- Dedicated 

Conviction 
- The concept that the metaphysics of belief has a very real influence of the physics of our reality
- Some individuals [Reality Stoner] have stronger input on the metaphysical belief aspect of the physical reality
- Has high correlation to subjective reality and the individuals reality. This influence is then combined with the subjective reality of others in conjunction to the objective reality and universal truths

Reality Stoner
- Someone with a very strong connection to the metaphysical belief field
- A reality stoner may feel as though their subjective reality has a spooky influence over the greater reality and everyday life of those around them; and even further

Mine Radio
- The place my mind travels; sending though, inner narrative, emotion, astral projects
- Where my inner narrative is constantly heard and where scanners and other spirits communicate with me
- Where, how, my body manifests an astral projection of myself

Mind Control
- Manipulation of thoughts feelings and the conscious self
- Can influence and even dictate decision and physical activities when done effectively
- Can be on an individual or population
- Population can be selected by attributes: mainly who has access to the signal such as which channel the message is sent on
- An application of Mine Radio
- A critical part of The Way philosophy 

The Way
- A philosophy intended to take responsibility for Mine Radio in a way that guides the world toward a positive direction
- Start by taking a measure of where the collective conscious or cultural zeitgeist is
- Describe, define, map out attributes of the measurements taken
- Define a destination of where you want the population to go, including direction
- Use tools like Dream Scaping, Strumming, Collective Conscious Inputs etc to influence this field
- Iterate: Take a new measure, define, utilize tools

Example of The Way in practice
	+ i.e. Cognitive Ethnographies of this subconscious field:
		+ Intentional meditation performed by a group of radio heads; taking note of proximity and context.
		+ Listen for the emotional state of a city or company or collection of identities. Consider how this place exists in the broader context of the physical proximity and domain relatives (if a company, how do they fit in with their competitors and peers)
