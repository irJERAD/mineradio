## First Among Us  

I once heard some words of reassurance:
"My son, know that I would not do again what I have already done."  
Voices interupt with aggressive questions
"I wont leave my son again"
"They should be asking: 'What is it they can do to pay?"


After some time I thought about his son dying for our sins and what a powerful sacrifice that was. 
Then, what a big debt that was to pay.
The sins of man..
How many men? and for how long?
Would this account for men not born on earth?
What about any who came from someplace else?


This debt would have taken an enormous cost from him. 
Parents send sons to war regularly throughout history making a similarly large payment. 


Women who have spent time here were surprised to see their souls going up first. 
Meanwhile, the men they were with seemed to drift backwards and out of focus. 

## Cancel Me?  
Sure, Let me tell you how they've done it so far.

Intent on impressing their vision of a pure peoples of our planet, our friends just below the border have taken a few blows. 
Those looking to transmute metals into wings launched sky bound weapons. 
Some meant to destroy a city block. Some had more craft in their attack and used precision biologically defined vessels.
