*Soul Crunching*

Smash pound jaw dropping 
On the chase hunting for fill; not taste
Filling on what but nothing.
Empty in all things, sustenance key among them
Full of used air. 
No value, only odor remains 
Eu de name. 
The a lucky few
It must have been
I thought you knew
Chasing these marbles
Down they go
As they run out
Do we not already know
