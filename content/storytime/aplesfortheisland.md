The island was as I remembered. 
A tropical paradise. 
Rich green accented with vibrant orange red and yellow flora. 

I walk the dirt road from my home to the terrea market. 
At the highway I see the change I had been feeling. 
This creepy serenity shadowing my footsteps. 

All the people were gone.  

The colors in the sky matched the flowers and fruits in the trees. 
Late morning air tasted crisp and a cool breeze invited a walk. 

As I walked the neighborhood path became the highway and pavement faded into an illusion of a wide dirt road.


Each time I reached a new body I would lean over and see their face as to great them. 
I looked into their face and recognized something inside.

I wore a denim white satchel across my chest. 
As I came up to each of the bodies I found left behind on the island I would take a moment to acknowledge them. 
Bending down I would spin my bag around and reveal a quiver of apples. 
Moist and cool they appeared to have a slight refrigeration to them. 

I would place it in their hand, close their fingers around the fruit and leave them with a kind thought.
