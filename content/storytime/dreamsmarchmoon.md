### March 7th: _She is off to New Zealand_  

**Experience:** _A snake for leaving a snake for lying_  
A familiar adversary appeared in his young spiritual guide form along with his powerful master. A powerful and rightful lord among the spirits the only individual I have seen him respect and revered as unrivaled 

### March 9th: _Legolanded safe and clear of snakes_  
**Dream:** _Reaching for another young shell_  

Drifting into a comfortable day dream
I found myself in a thick mud,
satisfyingly buoyant and ripe in temperature.

I reached down to explore my domain with an air of familiarity.

_My hand was caught._
An awareness kept over me like an impromptu release of digestive gas;
Desiring to neither acknowledge or accept it as my own consequence.

Somehow I knew a creature mouth was wrapped around my arm
and nearly to my elbow.

Standing up to pull myself out of the mud
I was careful to reveal my arm last 
_- to myself and now a third perspective I was viewing from -_

A large turtle hung from my arm.
I was not afraid for pain so much as uncertain.
The shame I felt slid behind my assessing the situation 
followed by the removal of the creature. 

A Sea turtle 
Identified by a prominent V-curve saddled by soft rivets.
Though Snapping, Box, even Giant
All titles silently pinned to an unseen mask.

Pulling up my right hand.
I immediately caught 2 fingers missing
and a third damaged with the only blood present.

I was concerned with my ability to play guitar; however,
in a particular fashion I had only recently began to utilize.

"You will have to put a hard one on top"
I heard a man comment
on what I thought was a solution to my inner defeat on
How could I possibly play guitar _now_

_Reaching for a Turtle_
Someone reaching for another child or another person to bear children for them.
Perhaps a disappointed in-law seeking a more appropriate suitor.
Maybe a religious group ignoring the call of one in pausing for a specific other.
Or a families designs to change previously held hierarchy of leadership.
_In the mud_
Not knowing or understanding what they will get
or the consequences of changing a single, significant, factor in a very large interwoven calculation.
