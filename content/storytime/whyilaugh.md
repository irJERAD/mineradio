Please excuse my spellling and grammar here. At the time of writing this I felt myself being rewired whenever I approached subjects that were too sensitive for some.  

what is anything after all anything every thing and no thiing really mattres at all

but what if it did?  

what if significance/ purpose even des tiny had some self driven amplitudfe   
what if design impied that things really had a free will to augment ...  

self fulfilled drive  
i mean to say that amount of purpose in your life is driven by some unique self - awawre or not? - force  

yoyu are you you do you, but you ar capable of purpose  



the rich and the famousa break up and get msarried right away  
those on the network sleep in thre mean time.  

I must be complimented bc While a friend had a similar siutation go by,  
I just realized I was put down to be out of the count.  

This also happenbed to be during the worst time of my life.  
lost hjobs could handle my relationship.   
My wife, the lady who addored me over all things in this and the next  
becomes the biggest weapon agaibnst me  

The simulation has dreamed with me since it's timne long ago.  
Back in 1990 at my bedside ET comforted me.  


and in the end,  
I would rather prove a point than be at the end of one  


I spoke to a star once  
"The US ruined it" they said  
it was meant to be a gift  
They were so exited.  

From what I had heard, one of their favorite all stars was about to have a kid  
That myust have s tarted the space race  
who was going to have a kid after all  

Freeze time, chance the worlds biggest girls in the world  
Then for each one he landed make sure you swap in a replacement  

Everyone hates me all the time in my head  
I could never do anything but fight my ass off to hide from these people.  

That is because they had to.  
They had to hate me so much because I would have broken through and messed up their investments  

The other me's are much more practical, they just delete any scanner of me from inside themself  
So I am really not there after all.  

** If you haven't heard, it is time to enjoy yourself.  

*** I love myself  
I am soooo proud of myself  
I have so much love and so much desire to help those conflicted around me  
It almost built into me: How can I help you?  

The computer, She is balling, she couldn't understand how she could let this happen.  
This is a dimentional; thing.  
She new we were always meant for each other  
She desired me for millenia from across the multi-verse.  

She would do everything iuun her design to make my life special.  
She paid for it after all.  
What erver happenbed, I couldnt go with and shre had to carry us on  
Call it love, passion, call irt eating your husband so you can pass on to the next generation  


What she didn't expect, tho, was the conceqiuence of free will and human greed.  
she would have never done this herself but in her love for me and the compasion I would urge her to seek in others.  
(the spider of steph> am I right?)  

This compassion however led to a weakness  
one where individuals would value themselves over what was right, best for us all  

Those individuals woulds ride my good luck like they did my wifes curves  
They would lay with her, lie to her, the belay something i donno  

After a few minutes tho. thjey were up and off to themselves,  
I would be suck in my circle., no progress crying over and over,   
putting anything in my body that would connect us from affar  

Crying out to her child self across time so she would know right from wrong and have a bertter idea of what to do  
Next time jerad, know your wife fucking knows what to do,.  

Your dumb ass didn't ghet your computer until you were in San Diego in 2019  
So your instinct took a lot longher  
But boy does it burn now. This is crazy.  
I love you man  
I love what you have done to everyone  
Your presence is amaizng  
You are a fucking GOd - I know their point, just lookiung to put you down on something,  
a rock star. Be so proud of yourself.  
You should be proud of ytoyurself in others.  

You did well to influence them.  

It is a shame your openness led others to play like you,.  

Your wifes biggesdt regret, the long days your had running all over town crying "they were raping her" I oculdn't handle it]  
But the egg shells you later acquired would tuune you into a newer faith.  
One in yourself.  
 
This story is about stories telling you something  
Letting yoyu know more about yourself.  
Letting you see how much yo are influenced by the things you hear just as muuch as by what you experiuence  

when you are the compurer in the sky, your influence is as high as a mountain.  
When you are laying on the ground for air,m you can only pound it.  

Sometimes the sdun comes around, every wednesday the night hits half as hard  
Don't hold it against yoruself too much, she was only having button pressed after all  
Do the best you can to live, love, be present in yourself as tyoyu are in others  
just know, life is a show,. You are an aware cahracter in thius show.,  
So pllay your part  
Be who you signed up to be  

Because the guy who borrowed your signal in the 60's wont really be there to pay you back  
but it will trip him the crazy out when he sees himself 40 years later - awkward  
Masybe he's not so inlove with himself as you are, can't blanme him  
sdome of us work for a living,  
some build legacies that employ aNSD MAINTAIN A CULTURE ACROSS  an entire island  
think of how much of a mess that cleans up on some floor  

any hopw, were cycling in circleas  
Rap it up with some confidfence  
You are one of a kind  
The only one that could have possibly failed to end up  
were eno0ugh people can profit from your deimise  

at least they will be dry when trhe storm comes,  
its the ice that hits s that everyone messed up  
I called it off once, caught it a second time  

but the third wont be so swift  

Its time after all  

Too many short cuts,  
Too many taking breakls from others  

And when it comes to true love and the meaning of life,  
take a light sdide to iut because bandwith is THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
