## Metaphor: The human soul is like a film  

Born completely empty of anything worldly, no light has touched the surface of the film up to the moment of birth. This is a new soul; a blank film. <br>

Etched over a lifetime as experience, activity, and mindset this film would walk you through a person in their entirety. <br>
Familiar aspects to be found printed along a soul would be:
- Personality and disposition mostly inferred from other aspects found recorded on the film
- Emotional decisions and their process
- Activities, Planned Excursions
- Dreams, Day Dreams, Wishes
- Plans lived through in your mind but not carried out to execution

## Dimensionality / Time

### Beware: The photograph captures your soul 

Some native american's believed the photograph captured their soul. For this, they refused to have pictures taken of themselves. <br>

Consider, a photograph collapses a __momental wave-form__. <br>

For a spirited ghost or soul, a moment could be a lifelong playground. They could be surfing the many pobable outcomes. Riding along a momental wave-form spending time in different possible outcomes:
- If I had ordered soup for dinner, then I would be enjoying a ice cream sundae for dessert. The catfish left me too full to endulge any further.
- What if I never went back to school, what would be happening to me in this moment?

## Defined
Momental Wave-Form: 
    - The probability distribution of outcomes over any given moment.
    - In This moment I could be just as likely reading or driving.
    - There is a smaller chance that I would be in New Zealand or Tahiti in this moment, and a very small chance of me being in Japan.
Collapsing the Wave-Form:
    - Once a decision is made\Measuring something through observation
    - Convincing yourself of a particualr reality
    - Accepting the truth you have received
