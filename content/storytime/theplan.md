## What must go on in that mind?

I get it. I often wonder the same thing and can find myself spiralling into these introspective circles.

## Accomplishments

As an outthinker of conscious beings on and off planet, I have reached some of my greatest accomplishments  

- Speaker of the Bat and their people  
- President of the Eternals  
- President of the Scanners  

But this is not enough. The price we have all placed on the line here has outweighed our very existance. 
Among the best causes we have promised our eternal souls while sacrificing the mortal vesels so gripped to by our fallen identities.


## A Doomed Fate  
Dishonesty is the norm.  
Relying on tricks require action rather than placing effort into defining a purpose to direct us.  
Tricks will desert you when your mouth and witt fail you.  
True purpose will lay _the path_ before you; 

Not telling me other people in this world would get to view my mind ruined my life. 
How does one think open the deepest and most intimate places in someones heart soul and mind would be an appropriate thing to do without even asking them?
That would be a fundamental misplacement of responsibility. 
What ethics lay behind the decision to heel in and refuse someone who was pleading for a simple answer to the question: "is this real?" 
Over and over they would have been seen, offering nearly anything in exchange for this request. 
Short of leaving my wife or committing suicide I had repetidly ran through myriad sacrificial attempts. 
Offering to stop or give up anything I could in exchange for this information. 
Lotto tickets, etc..
ALways because I knew one thing: There is not a chance in the probability curve that I would have become anything short of something spectacular had this conversation occured. 
I would have the responsibility of maintaining an upstanding persona to a public that would have been in awe of this newly discovered technique. 
This gift would have placed me in contact with a world within our galaxy.
