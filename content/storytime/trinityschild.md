A child with three faces. <br>
“Special people know,  
Jerad is good for the island(s)” <br>

Moisture of life drained into her core.  
Buttermilk skin turned to scales.  
Crack; shatter; fade to gray.  
Diamonds covered in dust.  
A slight breeze grants visual life  
To a fading vessel.  

White tiles. 
Squared grid.
Clean bathroom sink
A kitchen counter.

The Shaker grate 
Separates us
Like Chicken Wire
A hen yearning for her cock

A lone slug appeared
Hypnotized by their song
Doe eyed, [forgotten why, not her why, another way to get by]
Rung  to get along
Around earthly floor
The flood died up
Spiral drained

Relieve this boat  
Cured and sentient  
Push to pain with purpose  
Passionate talk  
Grow shoots and stocks.  
Around around and up we go
And then
