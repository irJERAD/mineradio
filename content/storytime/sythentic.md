*Synthetic* 

How does madness ensue?
Do we run out of money
Unable to produce food.
War, famine, social injustice
So many disparities 
our vulnerability’s would make us cry
Instead, synthesize something new
Without something we can never be full
Something lacking and it wont be me
Something scarce, something I didn’t see
Now that we need it
It can be
Greed
Jealousy


*Intelligently Unaware*
Woke dreaming
