Lets explore The Secret and Reincarnation with regard to the Soul as a Film.  
When as film is used, colors form from developing the burning of light onto it self. 

## Attribute of Soul Film  

- Frequencies: A signal measured by amount and size (amplitude)
    - Colors: With hue and shade colors give an outloud and upfront identity that declares what something is from a distance. Think of light colors vs dark colors; primary colors, creative blues, energetic yellows. Colors are relatively time independent.
    - Sounds: Sound is a very temporal aspect. How something sounds is in that moment. How a sound is received is also very influenced by what you hear before and after it just as much as what you hear with it.

    - Vertices and angle
    - Length of sides  
- Personal Subject Assets
    - Feelings
