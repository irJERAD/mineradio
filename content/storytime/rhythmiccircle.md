*Rhythmic Circle*

10pm the beach is cool with a slight breeze.
Lit by a full moon.
Impromptu bon fire encourages skins to shed and souls to sore.
Eyes caught across the flame introduces who I am.
Lightening splinters static down your body.
Dancing twist dodges the shame of fleet.
This is free.
This time we
Feel embedded bodies raptured
Turn taken game left.
We have woken in anotherâ€™s dream.
Farewell times he wept.
