I am laying in bed at a strange time; it must be afternoon.  
Not morning or evening I feel confused and dull; I am probably recovering, perhaps a day or two into detox.  
As they come into optical focus I felt the occupational aura of a nurse; surrounded by 2 or 4 glowing Chancy.  
I could not make out if there were one on each side or two on each side.  
They placed their hands into my legs about wrist deep and left a rectangular mark in the hair where they reached.
