there are new avenues of leveraging our platform together and rising us out of this our flooding bathrooms and into a zipcode of our own choice. <br>
Some of us simply want to live - **AND SLEEP** - in our own zipcode.

## Artist  

#### Palaver  

Palaver was written as the quintessential 

#### heather &the fleece  

The original radiohead artists heather &the fleece where our first artists on deck. 
They stepped aboard as MineRadio landed in the U.S. for the time back in oh-18. 
Experiencing what would become indicative of the _IT-curse_

IT-curse: Being _IT_ was intended to be a course. Targetting an individual and aiming to destroy their lives through the most frustrating means possible. 
This requires making life difficult but leaving things always within apparent reach. The best maintain a sufficient progression of pully-rigs to quickly adjust the level of frustration, physical and mental pain. Keeping the system in constant misery builds up a depression. Burning a level of pain motivates the cursed to seek out comfort and avoid punishment. 

#### Techniques  

**Sweedish House Mafia'd:** 
The vague aperitions of sweedish electronic rap groups build a sense of comradery. 
The cursed begins to imagine the comfort and practicality of the lederhosen atire. Resting _just so_ upon heir Swedish mounds. 

Rather than the support and cheer of lederhosen, feet hit the ground to the caluse splitting and desease of ledderhose. 

>Being **Swedish House Mafia'd** is akin to falling inlove with your Ex. Doe-eyed, doped up with hope and desperate to feel loved. 

In reality, they are a vicious creature, 
known for their capacity to tear your soul into tiny indestinguishable pieces; 
which are then easily reassembled into something of much greater worth than your previous self only moments before; 
all to be admired for a single moment as you watch the splash master piece crumble back down into a pool of shred me. 
Perhaps this skill of showing you someone you can work towards becoming was something you loved at one point but now it exists only to shame you of what you _should have_ become rather than what you _could_ become. 
Though you have successfully been seduced, most the effort has happened on your own account. Keep this in mind when your captors are surprised by the level of engagement and excitement that you begin to display after an internal dialogue catipulted you from hostage to partner in an intimate and trusting relationship.
