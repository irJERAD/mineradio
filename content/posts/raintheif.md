Look Around; Look Around  
I do not see you; You do not see myself  

Now look around who do you see?  
This is a person now using me!  

Stare into their brow  
Study them down.  

Gulp the static space  
between yourself and this imposter.  
Cold and tight as the environment around compresses unto a point.
Flashpoint. Erupt. Soul beaming.
