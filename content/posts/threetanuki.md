Staring intently out the window changing my focus to try and make out something where there was clearly nothing there. It was the end of a game night and still dark which meant we had finished up early. <br>
I had stood their staring out my window at the same tree-framed garden scape, when three Tanuki appeared standing infront. They must have been floating around 3 feet off of the ground. There 5 and a half foot tall body put them at about head high length with my 2 foot elevated floor.
