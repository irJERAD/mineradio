The little switches <br>
On the switchless <br>
Stitched up wetwear <br>
That outperforms <br>
most of us <br>
Typical stardust <br>
Day dreaming <br>
love lust <br>
matinee streaming <br>
Aren't meant to last <br>
so you can play hard <br>
Until you do bust <br>
Whatever it was you meant <br>
To keep shut <br>
Instead you do rust <br>
alone, isolated <br>
withdrawn violated <br>
your true self <br>
could have been anything <br>
or else, taken off the shelf <br>
opened, resealed, exchanged <br>
now your half off <br>
can't make the deal <br>
so you sit still <br>
While entropy make a chill <br>
eternal freeze <br>
Escape into the void <br>
pulled in post supernova <br>
to begin <br>
an ever ending disaster <br>
necessary to create <br>
a forever after <br>


It's about those small quantum things in your brain that expidite signals moving across space and time. <br>  
It's about time being space and what it takes to make something after all this becomes nothing. <br>
