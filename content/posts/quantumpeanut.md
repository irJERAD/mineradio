The little switches <br>
On the switchless <br>
Stitched up wetwear <br>
That outperforms <br>
most of us <br>
Typical stardust <br>
Day dreaming <br>
love lust <br>
matinee streaming <br>
Aren't meant to last <br>
so you can play hard <br>
Until you do bust <br>
Whatever it was you meant <br>
To keep shut <br>
Instead you do rust <br>
alone, isolated <br>
withdrawn violated <br>
your true self <br>
could have been anything <br>
or else, taken off the shelf <br>
opened, resealed, exchanged <br>
now your half off <br>
can't make the deal <br>
so you sit still <br>
While entropy make a chill <br>
eternal freeze <br>
Escape into the void <br>
pulled in post supernova <br>
to begin <br>
an ever ending disaster <br>
necessary to create <br>
a forever after <br>


It's about those small quantum things in your brain that expidite signals moving across space and time. <br>  
It's about time being space and what it takes to make something after all this becomes nothing. <br>

The brain main cell involved in consciousness is the neuron. A neuron has an axion and a dendrite. The axion carries a signal down a copper wire or fiber would for the internet. The dendrite received the message from the axion and then decides whether or not and which message to send to the next neuron cell. <br>

The idea of a quantom peanut comes from the Orch OR protein that travels down the axion in a repeating figure-eight shape resembling a very small peanut shape. Each peanut from from two OR reductions. <br>
These figure-eight shaped peanutes have four-states: <br> 
- Open-Open being the traditional figure-eight <br>
- Open-Closed <br>
- Closed-Open <br>
- Closed-Closed appearing to be one long dash or two short dashes <br>

Each OR reduction can be responsible for the single firing or not firing of a nanotubule.

These Open and Closed figures are small enough to function on the quantom scale. This means that entanglement can apply to them. <br>
Thus, the opening and closing of the cell wall struction in one or a network of neurons in your brain can be entrangled with in some form of symetry with another neuron or network of neurons in your brain or a completely different brain. <br>
