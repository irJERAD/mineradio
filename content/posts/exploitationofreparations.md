Halo broken I am bleeding out soul.  
Nightly pachinko games schism the dark metals that crowned me.  
First confidence then my calm demeanor, sunk in the sand as quickly as it were placed.  

We are done.  
We have had enough.  

As of Sunday March 22nd, the year 2020, we the Soul World are no longer capitulating to the demands of man’s archaic rulings.  

Granted the privilege of this earthly kingdom by God, man has failed their domain.  

Given a gift and bastardized it into a curse.  

With the beauty of language they curse.  

The capacity to connect our entire selves with each other on mine radio and they use it to poach.  
Special people hearing special messages. The voices of ancestors and past selves profiled by shame in exploitation of reparations.  
Filth misplaced in its claim to accomplish the work of dreams while they sleep.
