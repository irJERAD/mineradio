## Jerad Steven Acosta

My body is alive and well.  
It regulates and heals itself.  
My blood pressure will go down.  
The walls of my veins and arteries become stronger and healthier.  
My Heart is strong and resilient.  

Trust my wife with my life.  
My wife loves me and places me before everyone else.  
She gave herself, her temple, and her life to me in order for us to be together.  
Trust her, she the a plan.  

You are a talented member of society.  
You are worthy of a role that allows you to contribute in a significant way.  
You will take a position that accentuates purpose.  
Participation will add value to your team.  


# Mantra
A mantra is practiced daily. Write it down, say it out loud, repeat it over in your mind, walk with it, breath with it, be with it. Do this as you live with it. Your subconscious receives the messages we repeatedly live with. 

A  dream board captures your vision. Intentional goals collected as a tool to measure and reorient focus. Maintaining focus on where you are going encourages the appropriate vibrations for receiving what you are seeking.

## Measures of Success

How you answer questions when in a dreaming state. 
What answers does your subconscious provide when probed?

If you were asked what you wanted for your career while you were in a hypnotic state would you:
	* begin to reveal a fantasy of you as a creator, famous musician or global political leader
	* Bring up a promotion you ought to be going for at work

The attainable nature of a promotion that most likely plays into your overall lifeâ€™s direction and goals will allow your subconscious to be more impactful in its everyday influence.
Rather than pushing you to listen to one more song before leaving the house, you show up to work 5 minutes earlier. 
The magnitude of impact your subconscious plays in your life through decision making and action depends on how you use it. You should not rely on your subconscious to make giant leaps of progress in taking you from an unknown artist to a global phenomena. You can, however, boost your daily productivity and appearance by feeding yourself small and incremental steps.
