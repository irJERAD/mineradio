Comfy in my cloth dress <br>
I explore this realm <br>
Looked after, maintained <br>
Through my observation <br>

Close your eyes, terminals <br>
Screens on tables, aligned <br>
Surface glow from metric input <br>
Is this where I go? <br>

Gradient, measured, intent <br>
Absent ordered direction, I <br>
Find safety glass separates us, along <br>
A body, the horizon  <br>
between all absorbed, and <br>
All not <br>
