## Intro quote
### Monologue
### Inventions
#### Psychic Skin
- Skin like membrane that is sensitive to low frequency oscilations.  
- Vibrations are picked up as emf (not changes in air pressure like sound).  
- Membrane has metal pieces received from diet such as vitamins.  
- EMF charges the metalic deposits (see blood brain barrier and TMJ deposites in Jaw for examples in human).  
- Charges in the metal deposites are collected until capacitence discharges in a neuron like Ruffini or Merkle neurons.  

#### natural synthesis
How can we get this to happen in humans that have not evolved this yet?  
Neodynium magnents that are subdermally implanted?  


The times they are a changin'.  
It's a brave new world.  

With civilization about to reach a pass that while passing over we stop to look down and in a troubled reflection lose that extra measure of balance afforded to us by momentum.  
Like an angel racing down a dirt path on a unicycle built from his trusted stead after parting it inhalf to help a recently passing soul who appeared angelic and certainly had the best of intention, 
though in this same reflection it comes to mind how much of a hurry they were in for being stranded, 
in-fact the bulge in their side and breast pockets indicate the forsaken who pass time consuming rationed meals as hand snacks.
