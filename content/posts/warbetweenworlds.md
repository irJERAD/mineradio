# War Between Worlds

When imagining a great galactic battle. One between civilizations. 

When disparate worlds engage in conflict there is room for many misplaced assumptions and under calculated outcomes to really affect the outcome of the events.

/Particularly with regard to how things are handled afterwards./

Countries go to war and afterwards countries still stand.  
When worlds go to war wont worlds both still stand?  
Consequences compared with winner take all expectations.  

WTA is greedy and selfish and naive.  
Take the very real idea that two worlds will exist after two worlds go to war; what differences can be made here?  
Additionally, consider:  
When two worlds exist after war and the losing world expected only one world to exist afterwards.  

*Bad to deal with*  
Resources will be much less than they should have been. Gluttony, mismanaged waste and emotional destruction of assets could seriously undermine even the leanest of efforts to assist, construct, rebuild, and privet into positive prosperity.  

*Good to do*  
Communicate. Express humanity. Empathize with each other as opponents now and partners after.  
Precisely because we are opponents right now, we are required to be partners afterwards. A successfully survived campaign will require each of us to agree to, adhere to and impose post hostile arrangements.  
Opening a dialogue for post war discussions starts an early dialogue whereby both sides assume and act on the belief that there is an expected end to the conflict.  
Clearly express what it is each wants and why. Update these often.
