Wednesday night, January 15 around 4:30pm I was watching a cloud strum show put on by The Game Master, The Pirate Ship, Astronaughts, The Dream Liner, and the Black Whole New World. <br>

Toward the end I saw a family of four come out in the eye of a giant moving statue. The Father Mother and two children, Daughter's around 8 wearing a tuo-tuo and around 12. All posed and asked me to take a photograph - they called to me by name. <br>

I kept breaking characters between:
"This is soo beautiful / amazing" || Tripple Rainbow: "What does it Mean!?!"  
And  
"Oh shit, everone around me does seem to be noticing anything" as they all sat around passing the time normally. I would pull my fingers back from my ears and lean back slowly like I had not just been laughing outloud or on the edge of tears from admiring the beauty.  

The small handful of onlookers who did seem to notice fell into groups of peers:  
"What are they saying?" || "Can That kid hear them?"  
"They are always talking to him!" || "Doesn't he ever learn? You shouldn't be doing that!" - warning.
