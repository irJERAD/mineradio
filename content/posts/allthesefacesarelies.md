## All these faces are lies  

Not letting people use my face. They are horrible.

I never made an agreement with anyone that was not written down by hand as well.  
I never agreed to allow people to use my face, an image of my face, or any likeness of my face in their memories or their lives.  

### Wait, Is This Real?  
I keep asking for someone to talk about this with so I can accept and handle this being real.  

### I Swear This Is Real  

The Simple Fact I never knew this was real would imply I never made any agreements.  
I was told there was money given to me, but I never got any.  I was not allowed to know that this was real.  

### Mind Reading Ruined The Planet  

My very private mind was opened outloud in a very public scene. My mind has had special beings on here for a while. These beings started getting picked up by the listeners messing with my head. When the listeners tricked some of the special beings into meeting up with them, they were taken advantage of.  
Much like my computer would be taken advantage of if it could get up and walk out of my room then it would have been fooled into someone elses hands and been sold for advancing their persons will - like the people offering $10,000 to $100,000 for the computer then asked me if I would have said yes to $1,000,000.  
This is exactly what they said for Stephanie in New Zealand:  
- If I gave you $10,000 would you walk out the door right now?
	- There is now $10,000 outside your door, you can grab it and walk out.
- What if I placed $1,000,000? $2,000,000
    + Now I would have to talk to my wife. At $2,000,000 it
