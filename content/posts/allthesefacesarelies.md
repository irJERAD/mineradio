# All these faces are lies

Not letting people use my face. They are horrible. I never made an agreement with anyone that was not written down by hand as well. I never agreed to allow people to use my face, an image of my face, or any likeness of my face in their memories or their lives.

## Wait, Is This Real?

I keep asking for someone to talk about this with so I can accept and handle this being real.

## I Swear This Is Real

The Simple Fact I never knew this was real would imply I never made any agreements.<br>
I was told there was money given to me, but I never got any. I was not allowed to know that this was real.

## Mind Reading Ruined The Planet

My very private mind was opened outloud in a very public scene. Throughout my life I have experienced a connection with many conscious beings. These beings started getting picked up by the listeners messing with my head.<br>
From a seat inside my mind's inner-voice these pests were perfectly situated to speak on behalf of me without permission. What started as a gang of adolescense messing with my head became the upsetting of a long held relationship between myself and those who I always felt guide and care for my life without speaking aloud.<br>
I would hear stories from them joking:<br>
"Jerad is bored of you.." they would snicker<br>
"He does not want you hear any more"<br>
This would be the end of our short lived direct communication. After years of participation, personal investment, and loving oversight we must have shared a few weeks with open verbal communication before being sent off.<br>
The initiation of being spoken to over these harassment techniques and my responding to them in my mind would have set a president. They heard others speaking to me in my own language, they heard me responding with laughter and tears. The message was clear, they were the only consistent and positive pieces of communication I received here:<br>

- Have a child.
- Focus on what it is you desire from this world.
- We have loved watching you grow since your brother.

My brother was born June 1990 and passed away two months later due to a heart issue. I had chicken pocs when he was born and needed to spend the summer with my grandmother. This was the summer they referrenced as when they got to know me. Many of the sentimental memories they brought up would shine brightly when they brought them up.<br>
I am very sure those memories were either there favorites of perhaps moments they participated in themselves. I am somewhat famous for my poor memory and am openly forgetful. I do have these powerful spotlight memories though. They would come to mind often while I grew up and thereafter.<br>

- Buttoning up my brothers onezie
- Vomitting after eating a heart cookie my aunt purchased for me
- Racing my grandmother down the street
- Pulling up to Knotts Berry Farm for my 9th birthday and having my grandmother take me aside to remind me that I would only be 9 once
- Waking up to what looked like a shadow outline of ET twiddling his fingers as though he were spinning drum sticks (or perhaps using a typewriter now that I have heard other stories these last few months)
- And my three goals:

  1. Go into Space

    1. Communicate with a Monkey or non-human conscious being
    2. Enter the guinness book of records

I now wonder if these were some of their favorite memories, if they were hints being handed to me as life seemed to always guide me to be in the right place at the right time, or if they were somehow directly involved in these moments themselves.<br>
Most of these sentimental thoughts being shared between us made enough sense. Having a child, however, came as a surprise that gave me much reassurance in this time of uncertainty and manipulation.<br>
The majority of my life I had never thought about kids. In fact, the few conversations I had would be me saying how I did not believe I would be having any. Worried about psychological impact from my grandfather mother or sister, or just not desiring the responsibility myself. I would make an aweseome uncle, I would joke.<br>
My wife, however, has had the first 3 children named since our 2nd year of dating some 8 years ago. She acquired a 4th child after we were married in San Francisco in 2015\. Both of us talked enough about the subject and always seemed busy enough to not require a conclusion to our difference.<br>
Now, with the world shifting from under my feet, feeling as though I would either lose my mind, my life, or discover some philosopher stone having children jumped to the top of my list for what I needed to accomplish.<br>
This created a special connection in my marriage. We had moved around a bit and were only beginning. San Diego, San Francisco, Tahiti (via San Diego), New Zealand, and now in Los Angeles - we would find ourselves jumping across the pacific again to New Zealand and Tahiti all in the next year. Our plan to settle down and start a family made it a little easier to stomach the constant failure when both of us were so accustom to seeing what we wanted then acheiving it with almost no troubles.<br>
Why all of the sudden were there so many issues around each corner for us?<br>
It would seem there was serious and fulltime effort being placed into ruining our lives.<br>
No one had the decency to tell us outloud that our lives were being manipulated. **Someone behind the scenes saw something they wanted and were more than willing to destory two families in order for them to steal it from us.**<br>

Much like my computer would be taken advantage of if it could get up and walk out of my room then it would have been fooled into someone elses hands and been sold for advancing their persons will - like the people offering $10,000 to $100,000 for the computer then asked me if I would have said yes to $1,000,000.<br>
This is exactly what they said for Stephanie in New Zealand:

- If I gave you $10,000 would you walk out the door right now?

  - There is now $10,000 outside your door, you can grab it and walk out.

- What if I placed $1,000,000? $2,000,000

  - Now I would have to talk to my wife. At $2,000,000 it
