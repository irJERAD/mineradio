"Don't drink from the black liquid." - They say.
"Your heart is new, your debt in paid."
They have said this before.
It is always the same; however,
I do feel well, and I love myself.
I truly love who I am,
and there is something else.
No magic was taken, not a breadth or 4 or 5.
And although the ones above care not what I put inside,
only that I am cared for as I'll reach potential, 
it is in my design.

and now I lay here. Done. Punished for trying to be good.
A good boy for the mothers, a good man for the misses.
I did what they said, the care takers did not listen.


If there was a looking glass into the future, what would it say. <br>

What do we look like now? <br>

With eyes wide open,   
We know what has happened.   

With minds wide open,   
I was still unable to make sense.   

Communication could not have been easier.    

why look back and correct the stories   
when the characters have already passed on?   

I sit back to study a game; one that I was just told I won.  
The boat it took place on meant that exclusivity was bound by the reality of its cost.
