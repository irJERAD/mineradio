Daniel is professional in a militant fashion. Determined to complete the objective in the face of unsurmountable insufficiency.

Phil is punctual with a poignaint complusion for order. Seeking not only the respect of this order but also the dominance of it.

The order Daniel serves is one he wishes to preech. He is not one to preech down to; however he will preech at for a lack of base line level of effective action.

The prowess of each player is uncontendable. Each excels in every form while also maintaining unequivical performance in one or more forms of play.

Self-gratifying in his physical appearance Phil, unconcerned with the appearance of his attitude or maturity pulls off incredibly seedy and unsportsman like manuvers in order to assure a personal success. Most of the time a win does not qualify a candidate as sufficient. A manuver must succeed to the extremity or level that he personal desires and sees fit - most always including outperforming each other player in the personal aesthetic aspects of the competition.

A casual so polished it reeks of academia and organized religion, Daniel postures himself in ways to allow a continued statement to imply the correctness or success of his previous declerations.
