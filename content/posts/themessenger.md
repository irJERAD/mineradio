Late December I was working on this site and uploaded this photo. The picture spoke to me and I received a message. I assumed the message was meant to reach me in June because that is when the photo was taken. <br>

About the same time, Stephanie went to Morea and came home with electric teeth. Just over a year ago while I was in New Zealand Stephanie went to Morea and took a photo. <br>
