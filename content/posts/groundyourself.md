_Do This at least once a day and every night before you go to bed._

_Anytime you feel as though your reach extends beyond your gasp,
And you are not comfortable with how the world feels around you;
This exercise will bring your energy to a familiar level you are comfortable with_


Walkout hold together.
Take yourself where you intend to be received.
Give the earth your radical excess.


### Ground yourself

Feet planted
hips squared on balls of the butt
straight back square shoulders

ease shoulders further out
allow head to be pricked up from a strand of hair

You are a tree.
Your core the base.
Your legs long roots
Growing down into the earth.

As your roots grow deeper
your shoulders wider
your head reaches taller
Branches reach down, out of your nose, out your ears

Two ways energy flows
Down one leg
up the other

Down both legs
Deep into the earth
If you need help getting started or fighting particularly stubborn group
Focus on the ground
Visualize an extension of your legs growing deeper and deeper
Feel the liquid ground rise up your shin
