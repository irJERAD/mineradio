Familiar aspects to be found printed along a soul would be:
 Personality and disposition mostly inferred from other aspects found recorded on the film Emotional decisions and their process Activities, Planned Excursions Dreams, Day Dreams, Wishes Plans lived through in your mind but not carried out to execution  Dimensionality / Time Beware: The photograph captures your soul Some native american&#39;s believed the photograph captured their soul.</description>

Attribute of Soul Film  Frequencies: A signal measured by amount and size (amplitude)  Colors: With hue and shade colors give an outloud and upfront identity that declares what something is from a distance. Think of light colors vs dark colors; primary colors, creative blues, energetic yellows.</description>
