        <description>Let me clearly start this with:
I never endorse an aggressive response to an encounter with conscious beings - particularly those from a different place or time.
 One does not simply traverse the cosmic space-ways or tackle the metaphysics of phasing between timelines to arrive and start blasting radiation at the new individuals they find inhabiting this foreign time-scape.

I had stood their staring out my window at the same tree-framed garden scape, when three Tanuki appeared standing infront. They must have been floating around 3 feet off of the ground. There 5 and a half foot tall body put them at about head high length with my 2 foot elevated floor.</description>
