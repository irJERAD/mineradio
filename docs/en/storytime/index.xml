        <description>Metaphor: The human soul is like a film Born completely empty of anything worldly, no light has touched the surface of the film up to the moment of birth. This is a new soul; a blank film. Etched over a lifetime as experience, activity, and mindset this film would walk you through a person in their entirety. Familiar aspects to be found printed along a soul would be:
 Personality and disposition mostly inferred from other aspects found recorded on the film Emotional decisions and their process Activities, Planned Excursions Dreams, Day Dreams, Wishes Plans lived through in your mind but not carried out to execution  Dimensionality / Time Beware: The photograph captures your soul Some native american&#39;s believed the photograph captured their soul.</description>

        <description>Big Bag to Big Freeze As our universe presses on past 13.5 billion years, age gets the best of it. The ever accelerating expansion, dark energy and dark matter press us toward a big freeze.
Eventually, the growing source behind the force that visibly expands our galaxy apart from each other will press and press at our atomic particles until they can no longer maintain the structure we require for life and the physical universe as we know it.</description>

        <description>What must go on in that mind? I get it. I often wonder the same thing and can find myself spiralling into these introspective circles.

Voices interupt with aggressive questions
&amp;ldquo;I wont leave my son again&amp;rdquo;

When as film is used, colors form from developing the burning of light onto it self.
Attribute of Soul Film  Frequencies: A signal measured by amount and size (amplitude)  Colors: With hue and shade colors give an outloud and upfront identity that declares what something is from a distance.
