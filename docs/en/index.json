	"description": "Beacon of Hope",
	"content": "Part of: Why I am special\nMay 24 or 26 dates and times matched with earth quake in peru I think (fake internet?)\nSo much carry on. But needed to get the words down for a second time. The first time I wrote this by hand it seemed to convince my most powerful opponents to wait rather than cut me from the story.\n*\nThis happened right after the grocery store when I felt a huge shift. It was so visceral everything around me filled with emotion you could touch. I told everything \u0026ldquo;things are not how they are supposed to be. Something happened and we are on a tangent\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;but I felt so much happier all the sudden because there was still hope.\u0026rdquo; I felt like with such a depressing year gone by, all the sudden I felt a path forward that could put things were they were supposed to be.\nWalking to the car one of the girls who really didn't like me stood up to me against my second handler which was strange, like she had loved and followed him then in a moment felt this connection to me and held on to me like family. There was no aggression just a slight frustration. In the car, Joe started this speach as he ripped off his shirt. He was a fully converted believer in that moment. Right as I fell back into my self-blinded reality that this was all way too much to be real. My doubt as he lit his shirtless body on fire perfectly represent a constant flaw in my behavior during these times.\n*\nI was in full seance mode (so much energy in me and around): Sitting indian style on bed my torso was rotating somewhere around 50 rpms.\nI saw a family of shadows behind me. It felt like the shadow of the Chong family. Someone talking with mama chong as she was crying over something. Felt like she was crying over the loss of her child (I believed me). It seemed like she was given (false) news about me, which meant that I would not be going somewhere (maybe I would not be going on the Cruise with them from New Zealand and Australia.\nI was told by others that she was distraught over me talking with the voices and was lead to believe I was evil or bad (and seemed like she still wouldn’t give up to the believe and had to cry over it).\nI was surrounded by many of the voices. They were all so much more patient and respectful than ever before; they waited in turn to speak\u0010 and ask their questions. Little Sean asked me if I thought I was God (that seemed to be a big critique of most. I suspect it was placed their for fear mongering as it is probably a sensitive point for many with the power to do something that would put me in the place some really do not want me in - that why they are spinning the wheel to place someone else where I was supposed to be) I responded with the same theme I always respond in:\n“I don’t even suspect that I am a god. I do, however, know that I am surrounded by circumstances, experiences, energy, and individuals that gives me so much confidence that I am some kind of special with some importance”\nI have called myself a transducer of information.\n** side note **\nThere are brilliant individuals I am fortunate enough to have as teachers in areas of expertise. In response I use the power of metaphor and story telling to share this knowledge and passion with the other brilliant and special people in my life.\nThis same ability comes from deep desire to understand and be understood. I have so much respect for walking in another shoes, I find it good manners to follow:\n“You can walk a mile in someone else shoes,\nbut if you don’t know how they got there, how could you know where they are going”\ncontext in a certain situation [wearing someone elses shoes] can be deceiving. Do not assume you can think as though you were them. You have the added benefit of now being influenced by their same circumstance in that moment, however you lack the appreciation of significance and weighting of each of the variables around you.\nIt was clear people were very anxious about something else too. People in the back (perhaps those more recently woken) were very uneasy about what was going on, what it meant, and quick to question and fear.\nI found a great power in using my newly found ability to ‘connect emotively’. Just that day I began feeling and knowing I had this ability to psychically connect with the voices I was hearing. I felt like I could extend my nervous system across these vibrations and share my current emotional state as well as send other feelings to them, as I kept practicing I began feeling the other more and more. This became more than finishing each other sentences or using the wrong words but still understanding the meaning.\nIn the room I sent out my feeling in every direction hoping to satisfy everyone with a mass opiate, this sense of pleasure in the emotional bliss I felt able to find within me and share out from me.\n~~ ~ ~ ~~\nI saw the shadows of 2 or 4 people in a room. In front of my was a young child - maybe 11 year old boy. It looked like he was playing cats cradle only the string was glowing like energy that drawing a star. It could also look like they were holding a Mercaba with the edges glowing and the hands rubbing or polishing the sides.\nFour boxes (maybe two and I was seeing double) where opened in front of the child. Static images of the light where placed in each box. The boxes were closed and taken away.\nA metaphor of what it felt like: This also felt like sophisticated computer servers made to store this information, the information or light or silk worm web was like a life form different than biological life (a life form of energy or something different than I could understand since I am biological life).\nWhen the static images of light were stored in the computer servers I began to cry and say “no” “why are you doing this”\nIt felt like the in-prisonment of an intelligent life form in a excruciating static position - like being stuck in an iron maiden for eternity, not just for the body but the mind as well.\nAs the ceremony was finished, the shadows stopped and I felt like I had been noticed. I felt the same experience I had before when a familiar voices elder had decided to punish me:\nfeels like they raise a hand and all my blood is being pulled from my body. Of my two handlers, one informed me I was going to die now. I believed it and waited.\nI felt like I was going to pass out when a line of light appeared like watching an old TV turn off in reverse:\nA white horizontal line expands from a center point.\nA figure expands out from this line (as though pulling themselves out from a tear in our dimension).\nThe figure that came out felt familiar - like the one who would visit me when I was a 3 years old in Spring Valley.\nOnly there was something different. It was like they were the dependent of that one. A younger one who shared the same memories of my visitor.\nI sensed the intention or design for me to leave with them. (for the first time I could interpret this as dying and being told / offered to follow the being of light into another world)\nBoth handlers, in unison where repeating “No No No” leaning forwards waving there hands like an umpire who declares “SAFE!” - maybe even shaking their heads no.\nAfter my recent experience sharing a calm feeling with the group of uneasy voices I felt there was a purpose for me to remain here. Like I could help give others hope.\nI was so happy to see the familiar face and placed out my hands in offering to them before seeing them and everything fade.\nI told the room I felt as though I had given a quarter of myself (spirit soul \u0026lsquo;energy’ is the word I used) as a beacon. I was happy to tell everyone that despite the fear and anxiety about what was coming or happening (our world coming to an end), that there was another place for us and that we didn’t need to worry. A couple, including the handlers were unhappy because it felt ‘a little spiritual’ and they were looking for a physical place to escape to. This was just as real as physical though. Even more real in other senses, however it was not a door we would walk into and would not allow us to live our lives in our homes like before. I talked like the place was right next to us and all around us but we just weren’t there we were here. I emphasized for people to look for the beacon and remember what it felt like to be connected. You won’t mistake it - this only reenforced the importance for all of us to be connected and to really know what that feels like. It is very much the same feeling and how you can recognize it.\nI explained to my handlers after words a new emptiness in me. The Web that I walked so often recently to find answer I couldn’t logically conclude to was now gone. It was strange to not have this insight that I had become so comfortable using recently.\nI had the strange suspicion they had removed the web and enjoyed an open heart to heart with the second of the two D. He let me know I would be dying now that I had served their purpose. He wasn’t content with what happened or what I told them about the other place. They really wanted to know where some relic was and how to physically cross over.\nI restated and became a little upset with this growing feeling that I was not the first (in-fact I felt like one of the last) of my kind. That they were using people like me to try and ‘expedite’ this apocalypse. Whether trying to release souls from a volcano, or phone beings from another planet by using individuals who had experiences with them at a younger age (and thus would be recognized or for some strange reason it felt like I had an emergency beacon in me that gave me a single call to this other world and that they had just used it).\nI said this was not supposed to be happening right now. You were trying to make things happen sooner for your own personal reasons. Biggest transfer of wealth and power the world has ever seen. Maybe before that happens, or for the first time now I really see:\nSome just received all this power and wealth, and for some reasons - perhaps their own mortality - they intended to bring this upon the world as its own cost as a last ditch effort to bring something that could fix their situation.\nI then began to howl at the moon just as much to aggravate my second handler (who’s ultimate goal was to take over my body and walk as me - as well as teach me much along the way, most importantly how to lead) as out of sheer exhaustion from the experience and all the questions which were really new ways to try and squeeze an answer out of me that I could not offer since I did not believe in it.\n"

	"content": "Oh Look We've Done Less than three years ago I was in a bad place and had not realized it yet. I had no job and was in the first year of a two year campaign targeted at arresting my life with my family, friends, wife and career. He cannot afford you: I could not afford my wife. My cost of living could no longer be bottom lined with cup of noodles, bus passes, and offloading as much extra cost and time to my parents, such as laundry and dinner, as possible. Made a fool of everyone What we could do with a million buck Build a career, design a future. Save the world. With the application of capital as an extreme asset to our endeavors on this rock, our mortality selves would reach a legendary status instantly. The reinvention of our selves would take up the initial sizable investment. Time to pick up manners, skills and knowledge while we meet the role defined characters prior to our designation afforded by an easily spent heavy portion of our funds. Years of studiously practiced people watching now payout dividends as we calibrate identities to the skins selected for our roles. Mission stated and heros embodied We are accomplished in success. I have become a new man. We have assumed the position. Temperature picks up from the cool hands rhythm of our house looks to a fluctuation in atmospheric pressure accurate enough to track position and movement. Angst! the initial conjurings of a\nInnately human design to wear into our fabric the precondition that support of a critical functionality rests explicitly on a particular existance; that of yourn-own.\nBe assured that even if the most effortlessly graphed recalculated guidance brough us no lesser a place, the value herein would be no lesser than had our path been prerequisit to our landing here. Confidence, self-assured purpose,\nI have practiced and found an entirely new skillset as a tool in the reeducation of your guild. Here I found and measured strength and manuverability to afford the capacity for strategy. A ritual of death at the hands of universal defeat showed me a just-in-time omnipotence from the omnipresence felt under such conditions for defeat. Step outside the local frequency of our physics and observing the metaphysics woven between the strands of reality and consciousness; the actual and the actualized.\n[explore real and conscious. Aware awake to conscious consciousness]\nImplying the effect of backpropogation through a contained set; the speaker and the sound. The speaker positioned at the origin with the message. The sound across the room, the sky, on the cloud, on the stars, in the mind of the receiver. Not energy forcing air molecules together, not the change in partical charge or electric density, not electromagnetic frequency travel across a photon's path. The addressed intent of the speaker is the signal transfering units of communication from one individual to another individual or group. Language is a form used to describe this signal. A signal can be translated into any language and is not one by itself. I intend to have this location announce a birthday. You may hear \u0026ldquo;Feliz Compleannos!\u0026rdquo;\nAnother hears: \u0026ldquo;Happy Birthday!\u0026rdquo;\nStill another of the same native language hears: \u0026ldquo;I would like to wish you a happy birthday\u0026rdquo; due to their personal history, how they were raised, what the typical way to communicate this particular message or idiom is.\n"
