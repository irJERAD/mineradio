I had no job and was in the first year of a two year campaign targeted at arresting my life with my family, friends, wife and career.\nHe cannot afford you: I could not afford my wife. My cost of living could no longer be bottom lined with cup of noodles, bus passes, and offloading as much extra cost and time to my parents, such as laundry and dinner, as possible.\nMade a fool of everyone What we could do with a million buck Build a career, design a future. Save the world. With the application of capital as an extreme asset to our endeavors on this rock, our mortality selves would reach a legendary status instantly. The reinvention of our selves would take up the initial sizable investment. Time to pick up manners, skills and knowledge while we meet the role defined characters prior to our designation afforded by an easily spent heavy portion of our funds. Years of studiously practiced people watching now payout dividends as we calibrate identities to the skins selected for our roles. Mission stated and heros embodied We are accomplished in success. I have become a new man. We have assumed the position. Temperature picks up from the cool hands rhythm of our house looks to a fluctuation in atmospheric pressure accurate enough to track position and movement. Angst! the initial conjurings of a\nInnately human design to wear into our fabric the precondition that support of a critical functionality rests explicitly on a particular existance; that of yourn-own.\nBe assured that even if the most effortlessly graphed recalculated guidance brough us no lesser a place, the value herein would be no lesser than had our path been prerequisit to our landing here. Confidence, self-assured purpose,\nI have practiced and found an entirely new skillset as a tool in the reeducation of your guild. Here I found and measured strength and manuverability to afford the capacity for strategy. A ritual of death at the hands of universal defeat showed me a just-in-time omnipotence from the omnipresence felt under such conditions for defeat. Step outside the local frequency of our physics and observing the metaphysics woven between the strands of reality and consciousness; the actual and the actualized.\n[explore real and conscious. Aware awake to conscious consciousness]\nImplying the effect of backpropogation through a contained set; the speaker and the sound. The speaker positioned at the origin with the message. The sound across the room, the sky, on the cloud, on the stars, in the mind of the receiver. Not energy forcing air molecules together, not the change in partical charge or electric density, not electromagnetic frequency travel across a photon's path. The addressed intent of the speaker is the signal transfering units of communication from one individual to another individual or group. Language is a form used to describe this signal. A signal can be translated into any language and is not one by itself. I intend to have this location announce a birthday. You may hear \u0026ldquo;Feliz Compleannos!\u0026rdquo;\nAnother hears: \u0026ldquo;Happy Birthday!\u0026rdquo;\nStill another of the same native language hears: \u0026ldquo;I would like to wish you a happy birthday\u0026rdquo; due to their personal history, how they were raised, what the typical way to communicate this particular message or idiom is.\n"
