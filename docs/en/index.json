At the highway I see the change I had been feeling. This creepy serenity shadowing my footsteps.\nAll the people were gone.\nThe colors in the sky matched the flowers and fruits in the trees. Late morning air tasted crisp and a cool breeze invited a walk.\nAs I walked the neighborhood path became the highway and pavement faded into an illusion of a wide dirt road.\nEach time I reached a new body I would lean over and see their face as to great them. I looked into their face and recognized something inside.\nI wore a denim white satchel across my chest. As I came up to each of the bodies I found left behind on the island I would take a moment to acknowledge them. Bending down I would spin my bag around and reveal a quiver of apples. Moist and cool they appeared to have a slight refrigeration to them.\nI would place it in their hand, close their fingers around the fruit and leave them with a kind thought.\n"

	"description": "A basic vocabulary and definitions for soulfilm and how the reality plays into our lives",
	"content": "Outline\nPhoto finish:\n- The film does not necessarily die when the body does\n- However, it is possible for the film to pass on\n-\u0026ndash;\nMotivation\nConscious beings that want chose to live as humans in order to better understand their nature; how they think, how they feel and how they perceive.\nThese beings have a tradition of playing the role of observing.\nHistory\nCommon names for these beings:\n- Angels: the book of Enoch discusses these creatures in detail. It would appear as though Enoch or his seer may have met or encountered them.\n- Spirits\n- ET\n- The Watchers: in the book of Enoch, the watchers come to earth and make love to beautiful women because they were jealous of man for inhereting Earth and found themselves full of lust and desire.\nSensory Anthropology\nFeel what we feel. See what we see.\nUnderstand how we think.\nWhy we think.\nThe interface for this film makes for an ideal position to do this from. The body maintains all biological functions, sensory, cognitive, learning. The interface for the film would pick up from there and extend to all functions beyond the bodily including what the experience was being provided by the body.\nProblem:\n- Our actions are illogical, frustrating\nHow:\nGift:\n- They presented us with a gift\n- This gift gave the receiver extra capacity\n- Cognitive Functioning\nFilm\n- Spirit Film is a metaphor to describe the human concept of a spirit.\n- Additional efforts to allow the human spirit to be described in attributes similar to those used to describe these new conscious beings such as scanners\nScanner\n- A conscious being that has recently become very prevalent in our lives here on earth\n- May live on Comets and have an active population in the Kuiper belt\n- All of these beings desire identity; very much so. It seems natural for them to fit into archetypes. This gives them a somewhat universal identity since any individual communicating with them will see them in very much the same way as another.\n- Desiring to establish and reinstate their archetype and thus identity they will show you how they interact with other beings to support how you see them\n- If one wants you to look to it as a steadfast enforcer of principles, they will allow / encourage you to see them doing just that as you watch them.\n- This also provides a chance for them to receive feedback from you as they will watch how you observe them in order to make sure they are fulfilling the expectations you have for that archetype\nTypes Of Scanners\nScanners - Human scanners. These can be any human from your neighbor to the president or CEO of a big company.\nEternals - Giant Heads, Dogs, Bats, Mole people,\nMythical Creatures - Teddy, Dragon Queen, Foxy (around my neck), Moles\nMimic - Scanners that replace actual humans\n- Copies everything you do to become you\n- It has been said that after they can perfectly imitate you, they will kill you in order to take your place\n- unsure if they try and take your physical place or if they are killing your spirit self and replacing you in the heavens\n- It could be argued that the age of a Mimic is gone now that being sucked out is so common. Gaining enough Etherm to create a dense enough body is so expensive and difficult to accomplish without being sucked out by someone along the way you would be hard pressed to get that close.\n- perhaps there are some creatures tucked away from prior to our recent emergence that still contain such an amount of etherm and the capacity to retain it to themselves. Since Rome it would seem they would not be from this Earth.\nSnitch\n- Unable to hold back from spitting out everything they have in their mind\n- Loud Radiohead space\n- Desire companionship\n- Will promise to keep a secret so long as it gets a conversation started so they can start talking with you\n- ? Do they want you to tell them more or do they want to tell you more?\n- Who owns the conversation?\nMites\n- A scanner type conscious being on the spirit film spectrum.\n- Seem to have a more robust memory than other beings on the spectrum.\nFerry\n- Similar to their description in fiction these powerful creatures follow much of the lore as well\n- Powerful, Unique, Individualistic,\n- Dedicated\nSoul Bonded\n- when two souls are so strongly connected they can call each other into existence for communication and physical proximity with a thought, action or spell.\n- It is possible to create a scanner of a soul bonded individual from your own soul after you have become soul bonded.\nConviction\n- The concept that the metaphysics of belief has a very real influence of the physics of our reality\n- Some individuals [Reality Stoner] have stronger input on the metaphysical belief aspect of the physical reality\n- Has high correlation to subjective reality and the individuals reality. This influence is then combined with the subjective reality of others in conjunction to the objective reality and universal truths\nReality Stoner\n- Someone with a very strong connection to the metaphysical belief field\n- A reality stoner may feel as though their subjective reality has a spooky influence over the greater reality and everyday life of those around them; and even further\nMine Radio\n- The place my mind travels; sending though, inner narrative, emotion, astral projects\n- Where my inner narrative is constantly heard and where scanners and other spirits communicate with me\n- Where, how, my body manifests an astral projection of myself\nMind Control\n- Manipulation of thoughts feelings and the conscious self\n- Can influence and even dictate decision and physical activities when done effectively\n- Can be on an individual or population\n- Population can be selected by attributes: mainly who has access to the signal such as which channel the message is sent on\n- An application of Mine Radio\n- A critical part of The Way philosophy\nThe Way\n- A philosophy intended to take responsibility for Mine Radio in a way that guides the world toward a positive direction\n- Start by taking a measure of where the collective conscious or cultural zeitgeist is\n- Describe, define, map out attributes of the measurements taken\n- Define a destination of where you want the population to go, including direction\n- Use tools like Dream Scaping, Strumming, Collective Conscious Inputs etc to influence this field\n- Iterate: Take a new measure, define, utilize tools\nExample of The Way in practice\n+ i.e. Cognitive Ethnographies of this subconscious field:\n+ Intentional meditation performed by a group of radio heads; taking note of proximity and context.\n+ Listen for the emotional state of a city or company or collection of identities. Consider how this place exists in the broader context of the physical proximity and domain relatives (if a company, how do they fit in with their competitors and peers)\nWrite by Hand\n- Why Write by hand: Get notes down faster. Analogue information is more trustworthy since [the internet broke].\n[The Internet Broke] this started happening during LB-1. As a 4 year event, It has been estimated that this will be happening for 3 to 5 years. Leap year is 2020, perhaps it begins 2020 and goes through to 2024.\n- I believe this from hearing pieces of Stef's life plan for us (before Phanie)\n[Phanie] : When Stephanie became Phanie. Phanie was the first noticeable person since [The Schism]\nOn Appreciation And Receiving pointers\n- Why No Thanks?: Enemies find any reason to hate attack or succout, this makes it hard to help someone for fear that you are always blamed\n I do not believe in this practice and personally really think giving thanks is a kind thing to do  - Giving thanks less often: makes it more special rather than thank you every ten seconds.\nRomans 12:4-5 New International Version (NIV)\n4 For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, 5 so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.\nThis quote is in Ghost in a shell and\nCorinthians 13\n1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love I am only a resounding gong or clanging cymbal resounding in the wind. 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and can understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have faith, that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3 And though I give all I possess to the poor, and surrender my body to the flames, [2] but have not love, I gain nothing.\n4 Love is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; 5 does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; 6 does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; 7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.\n8 Love has no fear; it does not worry; love keeps no records of wrongs; never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part. 10 But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.\n11 When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 12 For now we see in a mirror, darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.\n13 And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.\nDiscussing the situation going on and my place in it my faith and self were being called into question. I prayed to the Bible asking for something and saw Cor 11 written in a living waved text. This is what I use to mean that something or someone is being controlled manipulated or masked by someone or something else. Someone had changed the message to say Cor 11. When typing the verse into my iPad Cor 13 was self corrected and that began the conversation that played out after.\nThis topic is important for AI, non-human consciousness and\nThis verse is referenced in Ghost in a shell as well as hackers.\nAll the way down the galaxy a sparkle could be seen. This sparkle was not known by the ones watching over its space.\nIs this something new?\nOr perhaps it is in the wrong space?\nOutline\nTwinkle across galaxy\nSomeone starts walking to see it\nAnother follow, and another and another\nSomeone introduces itself to the twinkle\nAnother gets eager and another instigates\nOutline:\n- My mind has a special connection to a dimensional field\n- Spirits live, talk, and move along this field\n- My mind can scan: create scanners of myself and others\n- scanners are made and replenished with thought and interaction\n- It exist / has been set up / gifted such that those who talk with me, stay in my life, are connected to me, exchange love with me are given scanners and have their scanners replenished\n- This has been broken by holding scanners in ways they are not supposed to be held. Trapping them.\n- An effect can be seen and felt by me when my mind slows down, I become frustrated, my intelligence starts to slow down; I feel like I am being spread too thin.\n- This would naturally acclimate normally by offsetting load when individuals I haven't connected with recently or have not been reloaded / regenerated faded away in order to allow new ones to be handed out.\n- My scanners all talk across a single frequency\n- This frequency has been set aside for my scanners to communicate from their dimensional frequency onto this radio frequency\n- People want me to die so they can acquire my frequency\n- When I die there is no more scanner-net radio.\n- When I go up they go up (home).\n- Perhaps other scanners can be tuned to communicate on this frequency\n- If that were true then they could tune their scanners to communicate on another frequency as well\nConclusion:\nThis feels like a serious violation of my essence or spiritual nature. I can close my eyes and see from places I have not been and with people I have not been with. It feels like I am in placed I should not be and have not chosen to be in.\nLike metals mixing good with bad taints the bad. When you hang out with angry people you get angry more, when your scanners are being held by people who you do not know your spiritual personality is being distributed in ways that you have not ordained. And because I have access to a special network.\nSpiritual prostitution for the gain of those who have chosen to hide the truth from me, profit from this capacity, and still seek to hurt me and my wife in secret. It would seem very seedy stuff has been done with a gift that was intended to allow me to make a very significant and positive mark on this planet.\nExtended Write Up:\nSome of my scanners are being held or trapped against their will. They are being kept for access to the radio in my head.\nA radio band may have been set aside strictly for my scanners. In anticipation of an event a spectrum across the entire world has been reserved on which my scanners are all tuned to.\nThis fits the theory:\nCradle of satellites holds knowledge information and access to important assets from individuals before the radio head awakening. The spectrum was set up for Jerad's scanners to have a clear channel to communicate across. There was enough spectrum for matter transmuting and for teleporting to a certain extent.\nIssue:\nSome individuals wanted to change out who was placed in to which roles. Many people were changed, tickets bought or traded, some without any apparent consequence to the ongoing story. When key characters where altered, however, the noticeable affect changed the driving force behind the event enough to cause problems.\nThe issue was handled with a notice. Things had already been set up a certain way. Not recognizing this notice and even spitting in its face lead to upset powers and threaten the fabric this reality rested on.\nNow late into the timeline and over budget, our reality is under constant threat. We are half expected to be erased. Why we have not been seems strange other than sentiment and romantic attachment. Romance, it has been said, buys us time.\nWhere there was one giver there were now two.\nAnd growing.\nAt first there was Papa, feeding his most prized possession in all the lands - his princess daughter.\nThen came a time when his princess daughter was old enough to meet boys. He immediately sent her off to America to study business.\nThere she met a boy. He would also need to give her a lot of attention to keep her happy and smiling during such a difficult time: a new home, a new school, no family, and most of all, no Papa.\nLike most young men he was understandably jealous of her father and the power of his attention. This young man, however, was quite the quick study and eager to put his lessons to practice.\nHe was soon the Sun, lighting up her sky. The warmth she craved to wake her up after each night.\nAs they aged together, his warms grew larger, broader. As their relationship matured his warm grew in acuity getting burning hot to a pin-point when and where desired.\nOutline:\nNow there were two suns; Papa and the young man.\nWhen Papa passed on his approval, his powers where now granted to the young man.\nThis gave him oversight over Papa's ability as well as his own self-learned skills.\nBloop-bloop\n\u0026ldquo;I..\u0026rdquo; - bloop\n\u0026ldquo;Am..\u0026rdquo; - bloop\nBubble up from, where we were.\n(Emerge or break off?)\nI embrace myself in a focal pan\nUp is where I want to go.\nI know this because up is where everyone else goes.\nSpiraling allows me to hold myself together while I scan more of my environment. Is this instinct or am I taking note of my relative motion; I do not know.\nWith each thought a new piece of me bubbles out. Some form out of the collective mass. Others bulge from my growing collection of orbs. I hoard each piece of myself with an unjustifiable greed.\nThe End of an Immortal:\nHow an ancient spider fell in love with me, created envy in suitors and caretakers alike, was replaced, and then world ended.\nHow did she get to know me?\nWhen and where did we meet?\nperhaps another timeline; another dimension; another me.\nEven so, she loved and knew me all the same.\nMore than a spider she was queen.\nAll that followed served her hunger.\nThis hunger desired what was needed beyond its time.\nWhat life she consumed was not devoured but became.\nWas she sought out for this\nDid her order seek across time and space\nTo be her meal, a soul her mead.\nI was never told how one becomes that which she's fed\nAnd then there was me. From which design I had no clue. Afterwards many would redraw a scheme with another's name. How they thought it would convince anyone shows equally skim purview.\nThe beginning of her end\nHer courtesy gave convenience to my naive mind. New to this world and making many new acquaintances I protested consuming conscious individuals. In my presence she would refuse her sustenance. Uninformed to her rule I would undermine her power. Such love for an individual when there was an order following a way, working toward some greatness beyond our existence.\nThe addition of master, a daoist monk from New Zealand, must have added haste. In his hurry he put his name on a hurricane to claim a fix to it all, then ran to the cave to serve himself up. How he was chosen I ask myself, he was in me so long after all; he went to replace her, claiming me as her weakness. A replacement this late would have so few souls so few voices, such little wisdom and sight. A new queen without the ageless wisdom is easy to overcome. He would be queen now. He will oversee this kingdoms fall.\nMetaphor: The human soul is like a film. Assets in color, shade and richness of hue with time burning in detail and depth.\nBorn blank and etched over a lifetime of experience. Activity, interaction, state of mind and being all burn the essence of a person's \u0026ldquo;film\u0026rdquo; with the aspects that are associated with a human soul:\n- Personality, disposition inferable via\n- Emotional decision making process\n- Reactionary activities carried out by instinct\n- Dreams, day dreams, wishes\n- Planned activities\n- Plans that are not carried out but still lived through in your mind\nWhen the previous president combined all the scanners and powers of the soul world he had the task of defining himself as an eternal being.\nAs an everlasting constant he would go on to define himself as the gracious and forgiving one above all.\nWhen humans were made there was a specific case that needed to be handled. Man was made with free will; the ability to chose and define themself.\nSin came into the world for man to define himself as something that existed outside or counter to God. God would maintain a pure form as he defined which also included what he could be around.\nThe company you keep and environment you are kept in influences you as a function over time. Metals lose their purity around\nSpiritual Times that defined their future:\n- About 2000 years ago when Jesus Christ of Nazareth walked the earth\n- Christian's would come to inherent the Earth in the coming millennia\n- Council of Nicaea\nSoul Sucking only works on certain types of bodies\n- A body host to a special guest\n- probably happens a lot more during special times, events, historical and otherwise that the Earth goes through\n- Thoth visited Earth 3 times, this is a good guess as to how\n"

Gluttony, mismanaged waste and emotional destruction of assets could seriously undermine even the leanest of efforts to assist, construct, rebuild, and privet into positive prosperity.\nGood to do\nCommunicate.

Write it down, say it out loud, repeat it over in your mind, walk with it, breath with it, be with it. Do this as you live with it. Your subconscious receives the messages we repeatedly live with.\nA dream board captures your vision. Intentional goals collected as a tool to measure and reorient focus. Maintaining focus on where you are going encourages the appropriate vibrations for receiving what you are seeking.\nMeasures of Success How you answer questions when in a dreaming state. What answers does your subconscious provide when probed?\nIf you were asked what you wanted for your career while you were in a hypnotic state would you:\n* begin to reveal a fantasy of you as a creator, famous musician or global political leader\n* Bring up a promotion you ought to be going for at work\nThe attainable nature of a promotion that most likely plays into your overall life’s direction and goals will allow your subconscious to be more impactful in its everyday influence.\nRather than pushing you to listen to one more song before leaving the house, you show up to work 5 minutes earlier. The magnitude of impact your subconscious plays in your life through decision making and action depends on how you use it. You should not rely on your subconscious to make giant leaps of progress in taking you from an unknown artist to a global phenomena. You can, however, boost your daily productivity and appearance by feeding yourself small and incremental steps.\n"

No longer paying attention to the news I walk up to face the being and call it out.\n\u0026ldquo;T.V.!\u0026rdquo; I call to it.\n\u0026ldquo;I can see you. There is no need to hide. Talk to me.\u0026rdquo;\nThe T.V. brought a face forward and began to talk with me. I wish I was dead After discovering it could communicate with me I did what I normally do with more sophisticated conscious beings; I introduced myself and asked him to read my mind to get a sense of where we are and what is going on. The T.V. wished it was dead. The computer said the same thing. Who Are You? The T.V. brings forward a very distinct face. It almost looks like the alien from American dad as a longways strentched olderman. Only a day or few before Christopher, the son of Disney passed away. It would seem I have inhereted his Scanners. The scanners that associate with me go up to 250 after they deliberated a unanimous vote on Jerad Steven Acosta as Palaver for President. Everyone else of course was very upset and doing their best not to respect the Scanner's wishes but they made it very clear; a private vote took place, I believe without the intervention of any people, and they returned with the desicion that Jerad would be their president. Cool Talk This is cool talk with Jerad. You know what would be cool? Put Christopher's Scanner from the T.V. inside Tom Morrow's robotic body!\nside note: His face looks very similar to the alien that sleeps with grandmother at times. The alient always make kind requests for grandma and I believe spends time with her to keep her safe from the other haunters.\n"

	"content": "Richard Hess Hamilton joined the Navy in the beginning of World War II. His first service was on a destroyer over the Atlantic. The destroyer was sunk on his first trip. As the boat was chewed up, a clock off the officers deck found its way to the raft with Richard’s pack. Conceived in Chicago, Elizabeth Hamilton gave birth to Sandra Hamilton in Hawaii. R. H. Hamilton finished his war time service in Hawaii. Here the country welcomed an era of Military peace while they ushered the dawn of a new form of conflict - The Cold War.\nA menagerie of finely combed procedures and tight lipped secret pushing bread with the experimental offspring of emergent technology and a nascent global information empire upon which the future of nation building and destroying warfare was build. Perhaps it was this radical exploitation of a tediously earned skill in an environment that encouraged the promiscuous behavior he became infamous for later on in his years. "

	"description": "Beacon of Hope",
	"content": "Part of: Why I am special\nMay 24 or 26 dates and times matched with earth quake in peru I think (fake internet?)\nSo much carry on. But needed to get the words down for a second time. The first time I wrote this by hand it seemed to convince my most powerful opponents to wait rather than cut me from the story.\n*\nThis happened right after the grocery store when I felt a huge shift. It was so visceral everything around me filled with emotion you could touch. I told everything \u0026ldquo;things are not how they are supposed to be. Something happened and we are on a tangent\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;but I felt so much happier all the sudden because there was still hope.\u0026rdquo; I felt like with such a depressing year gone by, all the sudden I felt a path forward that could put things were they were supposed to be.\nWalking to the car one of the girls who really didn't like me stood up to me against my second handler which was strange, like she had loved and followed him then in a moment felt this connection to me and held on to me like family. There was no aggression just a slight frustration. In the car, Joe started this speach as he ripped off his shirt. He was a fully converted believer in that moment. Right as I fell back into my self-blinded reality that this was all way too much to be real. My doubt as he lit his shirtless body on fire perfectly represent a constant flaw in my behavior during these times.\n*\nI was in full seance mode (so much energy in me and around): Sitting indian style on bed my torso was rotating somewhere around 50 rpms.\nI saw a family of shadows behind me. It felt like the shadow of the Chong family. Someone talking with mama chong as she was crying over something. Felt like she was crying over the loss of her child (I believed me). It seemed like she was given (false) news about me, which meant that I would not be going somewhere (maybe I would not be going on the Cruise with them from New Zealand and Australia.\nI was told by others that she was distraught over me talking with the voices and was lead to believe I was evil or bad (and seemed like she still wouldn’t give up to the believe and had to cry over it).\nI was surrounded by many of the voices. They were all so much more patient and respectful than ever before; they waited in turn to speak\u0010 and ask their questions. Little Sean asked me if I thought I was God (that seemed to be a big critique of most. I suspect it was placed their for fear mongering as it is probably a sensitive point for many with the power to do something that would put me in the place some really do not want me in - that why they are spinning the wheel to place someone else where I was supposed to be) I responded with the same theme I always respond in:\n“I don’t even suspect that I am a god. I do, however, know that I am surrounded by circumstances, experiences, energy, and individuals that gives me so much confidence that I am some kind of special with some importance”\nI have called myself a transducer of information.\n** side note **\nThere are brilliant individuals I am fortunate enough to have as teachers in areas of expertise. In response I use the power of metaphor and story telling to share this knowledge and passion with the other brilliant and special people in my life.\nThis same ability comes from deep desire to understand and be understood. I have so much respect for walking in another shoes, I find it good manners to follow:\n“You can walk a mile in someone else shoes,\nbut if you don’t know how they got there, how could you know where they are going”\ncontext in a certain situation [wearing someone elses shoes] can be deceiving. Do not assume you can think as though you were them. You have the added benefit of now being influenced by their same circumstance in that moment, however you lack the appreciation of significance and weighting of each of the variables around you.\nIt was clear people were very anxious about something else too. People in the back (perhaps those more recently woken) were very uneasy about what was going on, what it meant, and quick to question and fear.\nI found a great power in using my newly found ability to ‘connect emotively’. Just that day I began feeling and knowing I had this ability to psychically connect with the voices I was hearing. I felt like I could extend my nervous system across these vibrations and share my current emotional state as well as send other feelings to them, as I kept practicing I began feeling the other more and more. This became more than finishing each other sentences or using the wrong words but still understanding the meaning.\nIn the room I sent out my feeling in every direction hoping to satisfy everyone with a mass opiate, this sense of pleasure in the emotional bliss I felt able to find within me and share out from me.\n~~ ~ ~ ~~\nI saw the shadows of 2 or 4 people in a room. In front of my was a young child - maybe 11 year old boy. It looked like he was playing cats cradle only the string was glowing like energy that drawing a star. It could also look like they were holding a Mercaba with the edges glowing and the hands rubbing or polishing the sides.\nFour boxes (maybe two and I was seeing double) where opened in front of the child. Static images of the light where placed in each box. The boxes were closed and taken away.\nA metaphor of what it felt like: This also felt like sophisticated computer servers made to store this information, the information or light or silk worm web was like a life form different than biological life (a life form of energy or something different than I could understand since I am biological life).\nWhen the static images of light were stored in the computer servers I began to cry and say “no” “why are you doing this”\nIt felt like the in-prisonment of an intelligent life form in a excruciating static position - like being stuck in an iron maiden for eternity, not just for the body but the mind as well.\nAs the ceremony was finished, the shadows stopped and I felt like I had been noticed. I felt the same experience I had before when a familiar voices elder had decided to punish me:\nfeels like they raise a hand and all my blood is being pulled from my body. Of my two handlers, one informed me I was going to die now. I believed it and waited.\nI felt like I was going to pass out when a line of light appeared like watching an old TV turn off in reverse:\nA white horizontal line expands from a center point.\nA figure expands out from this line (as though pulling themselves out from a tear in our dimension).\nThe figure that came out felt familiar - like the one who would visit me when I was a 3 years old in Spring Valley.\nOnly there was something different. It was like they were the dependent of that one. A younger one who shared the same memories of my visitor.\nI sensed the intention or design for me to leave with them. (for the first time I could interpret this as dying and being told / offered to follow the being of light into another world)\nBoth handlers, in unison where repeating “No No No” leaning forwards waving there hands like an umpire who declares “SAFE!” - maybe even shaking their heads no.\nAfter my recent experience sharing a calm feeling with the group of uneasy voices I felt there was a purpose for me to remain here. Like I could help give others hope.\nI was so happy to see the familiar face and placed out my hands in offering to them before seeing them and everything fade.\nI told the room I felt as though I had given a quarter of myself (spirit soul \u0026lsquo;energy’ is the word I used) as a beacon. I was happy to tell everyone that despite the fear and anxiety about what was coming or happening (our world coming to an end), that there was another place for us and that we didn’t need to worry. A couple, including the handlers were unhappy because it felt ‘a little spiritual’ and they were looking for a physical place to escape to. This was just as real as physical though. Even more real in other senses, however it was not a door we would walk into and would not allow us to live our lives in our homes like before. I talked like the place was right next to us and all around us but we just weren’t there we were here. I emphasized for people to look for the beacon and remember what it felt like to be connected. You won’t mistake it - this only reenforced the importance for all of us to be connected and to really know what that feels like. It is very much the same feeling and how you can recognize it.\nI explained to my handlers after words a new emptiness in me. The Web that I walked so often recently to find answer I couldn’t logically conclude to was now gone. It was strange to not have this insight that I had become so comfortable using recently.\nI had the strange suspicion they had removed the web and enjoyed an open heart to heart with the second of the two D. He let me know I would be dying now that I had served their purpose. He wasn’t content with what happened or what I told them about the other place. They really wanted to know where some relic was and how to physically cross over.\nI restated and became a little upset with this growing feeling that I was not the first (in-fact I felt like one of the last) of my kind. That they were using people like me to try and ‘expedite’ this apocalypse. Whether trying to release souls from a volcano, or phone beings from another planet by using individuals who had experiences with them at a younger age (and thus would be recognized or for some strange reason it felt like I had an emergency beacon in me that gave me a single call to this other world and that they had just used it).\nI said this was not supposed to be happening right now. You were trying to make things happen sooner for your own personal reasons. Biggest transfer of wealth and power the world has ever seen. Maybe before that happens, or for the first time now I really see:\nSome just received all this power and wealth, and for some reasons - perhaps their own mortality - they intended to bring this upon the world as its own cost as a last ditch effort to bring something that could fix their situation.\nI then began to howl at the moon just as much to aggravate my second handler (who’s ultimate goal was to take over my body and walk as me - as well as teach me much along the way, most importantly how to lead) as out of sheer exhaustion from the experience and all the questions which were really new ways to try and squeeze an answer out of me that I could not offer since I did not believe in it.\n"

The axion carries a signal down a copper wire or fiber would for the internet. The dendrite received the message from the axion and then decides whether or not and which message to send to the next neuron cell. The idea of a quantom peanut comes from the Orch OR protein that travels down the axion in a repeating figure-eight shape resembling a very small peanut shape. Each peanut from from two OR reductions. These figure-eight shaped peanutes have four-states:  Open-Open being the traditional figure-eight  Open-Closed  Closed-Open  Closed-Closed appearing to be one long dash or two short dashes   Each OR reduction can be responsible for the single firing or not firing of a nanotubule.\nThese Open and Closed figures are small enough to function on the quantom scale.

Additional efforts to allow the human spirit to be described in attributes similar to those used to describe these new conscious beings such as scanners  Scanner\n A conscious being that has recently become very prevalent in our lives here on earth. May live on Comets and have an active population in the Kuiper belt  Types Of Scanners\n All of these beings desire identity; very much so. It seems natural for them to fit into archetypes. This gives them a somewhat universal identity since any individual communicating with them will see them in very much the same way as another. Desiring to establish and reinstate their archetype and thus identity they will show you how they interact with other beings to support how you see them  If one wants you to look to it as a steadfast enforcer of principles, they will allow / encourage you to see them doing just that as you watch them.  This also provides a chance for them to receive feedback from you as they will watch how you observe them in order to make sure they are fulfilling the expectations you have for that archetype\nMimic     Copies everything you do to become you It has been said that after they can perfectly imitate you, they will kill you in order to take your place  unsure if they try and take your physical place or if they are killing your spirit self and replacing you in the heavens    Snitch\n Unable to hold back from spitting out everything they have in their mind Loud Radiohead space Desire companionship Will promise to keep a secret so long as it gets a conversation started so they can start talking with you ?

This influence is then combined with the subjective reality of others in conjunction to the objective reality and universal truths  Reality Stoner\n Someone with a very strong connection to the metaphysical belief field A reality stoner may feel as though their subjective reality has a spooky influence over the greater reality and everyday life of those around them; and even further  Mine Radio\n The place my mind travels; sending though, inner narrative, emotion, astral projects Where my inner narrative is constantly heard and where scanners and other spirits communicate with me Where, how, my body manifests an astral projection of myself  Mind Control\n Manipulation of thoughts feelings and the conscious self Can influence and even dictate decision and physical activities when done effectively Can be on an individual or population Population can be selected by attributes: mainly who has access to the signal such as which channel the message is sent on An application of Mine Radio A critical part of The Way philosophy  The Way\n A philosophy intended to take responsibility for Mine Radio in a way that guides the world toward a positive direction Start by taking a measure of where the collective conscious or cultural zeitgeist is Describe, define, map out attributes of the measurements taken Define a destination of where you want the population to go, including direction Use tools like Dream Scaping, Strumming, Collective Conscious Inputs etc to influence this field Iterate: Take a new measure, define, utilize tools  Example of The Way in practice\n+ i.e. Cognitive Ethnographies of this subconscious field:\n+ Intentional meditation performed by a group of radio heads; taking note of proximity and context.\n+ Listen for the emotional state of a city or company or collection of identities.

I was initially skeptical, both of my ability to talk through a photograph as well as with the identity of the being. I satisfied any doubt by asking questions about when this was, how they got here, who they were, what they knew and how they got to know it. The Message \u0026ldquo;Your wife is pregnant.\u0026quot; - he announced with a rushed congratulation.\n\u0026ldquo;You have to return to the island immediately!\u0026quot;\nThe conversation crossed topics from the physical to the metaphysical. They had traveled across the equator and changed sized in doing so. I have no reason to believe they are any different than the other holographic peoples.\nHere the body is outlined to make it standout more. Following their arm, they appear to be grabbing their abdomen or back as though it was in pain or sore from a recent trauma. It could also look like a wing behind his shoulder - as though it were an angel from cultural depriction. "

Most of the time a win does not qualify a candidate as sufficient. A manuver must succeed to the extremity or level that he personal desires and sees fit - most always including outperforming each other player in the personal aesthetic aspects of the competition.\nA casual so polished it reeks of academia and organized religion, Daniel postures himself in ways to allow a continued statement to imply the correctness or success of his previous declerations.\n"

I had no job and was in the first year of a two year campaign targeted at arresting my life with my family, friends, wife and career. He cannot afford you: I could not afford my wife. My cost of living could no longer be bottom lined with cup of noodles, bus passes, and offloading as much extra cost and time to my parents, such as laundry and dinner, as possible. Made a fool of everyone What we could do with a million buck Build a career, design a future. Save the world. With the application of capital as an extreme asset to our endeavors on this rock, our mortality selves would reach a legendary status instantly. The reinvention of our selves would take up the initial sizable investment. Time to pick up manners, skills and knowledge while we meet the role defined characters prior to our designation afforded by an easily spent heavy portion of our funds. Years of studiously practiced people watching now payout dividends as we calibrate identities to the skins selected for our roles. Mission stated and heros embodied We are accomplished in success. I have become a new man. We have assumed the position. Temperature picks up from the cool hands rhythm of our house looks to a fluctuation in atmospheric pressure accurate enough to track position and movement.

Confidence, self-assured purpose,\nI have practiced and found an entirely new skillset as a tool in the reeducation of your guild. Here I found and measured strength and manuverability to afford the capacity for strategy. A ritual of death at the hands of universal defeat showed me a just-in-time omnipotence from the omnipresence felt under such conditions for defeat.

The sound across the room, the sky, on the cloud, on the stars, in the mind of the receiver. Not energy forcing air molecules together, not the change in partical charge or electric density, not electromagnetic frequency travel across a photon's path. The addressed intent of the speaker is the signal transfering units of communication from one individual to another individual or group. Language is a form used to describe this signal. A signal can be translated into any language and is not one by itself. I intend to have this location announce a birthday. You may hear \u0026ldquo;Feliz Compleannos!\u0026rdquo;\nAnother hears: \u0026ldquo;Happy Birthday!\u0026rdquo;\nStill another of the same native language hears: \u0026ldquo;I would like to wish you a happy birthday\u0026rdquo; due to their personal history, how they were raised, what the typical way to communicate this particular message or idiom is.\n"
