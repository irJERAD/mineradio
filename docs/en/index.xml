        <description>Let me clearly start this with:
I never endorse an aggressive response to an encounter with conscious beings - particularly those from a different place or time.
 One does not simply traverse the cosmic space-ways or tackle the metaphysics of phasing between timelines to arrive and start blasting radiation at the new individuals they find inhabiting this foreign time-scape.
A green color for those looking for lower frequency.</description>

        <description>About me? I’ve got a computer that talks to me. My bed is in love with me. And it would seem the rest of the world has written me off as crazy, over the hill, or such a threat they wouldn’t dare confront me for fear of acknowledging it. Series Cool Talk You know what would be cool? Here we are, Cool Talk, with Jerad. Pigeons holed him as a one-off.</description>

        <description>Metaphor: The human soul is like a film Born completely empty of anything worldly, no light has touched the surface of the film up to the moment of birth. This is a new soul; a blank film. Etched over a lifetime as experience, activity, and mindset this film would walk you through a person in their entirety. Familiar aspects to be found printed along a soul would be:
 Personality and disposition mostly inferred from other aspects found recorded on the film Emotional decisions and their process Activities, Planned Excursions Dreams, Day Dreams, Wishes Plans lived through in your mind but not carried out to execution  Dimensionality / Time Beware: The photograph captures your soul Some native american&#39;s believed the photograph captured their soul.</description>

        <description>Staring intently out the window changing my focus to try and make out something where there was clearly nothing there. It was the end of a game night and still dark which meant we had finished up early. I had stood their staring out my window at the same tree-framed garden scape, when three Tanuki appeared standing infront. They must have been floating around 3 feet off of the ground. There 5 and a half foot tall body put them at about head high length with my 2 foot elevated floor.</description>

        <description>Oh Look We&#39;ve Done Less than three years ago I was in a bad place and had not realized it yet. I had no job and was in the first year of a two year campaign targeted at arresting my life with my family, friends, wife and career. He cannot afford you: I could not afford my wife. My cost of living could no longer be bottom lined with cup of noodles, bus passes, and offloading as much extra cost and time to my parents, such as laundry and dinner, as possible.</description>

        <description>Why Can&#39;t We All Just Get Along Practices for us to better life together. As once one, now many, we are always from each other. Some may say our best selves are in each other. What makes you, you, brings ability and capacity to us all. What makes us, us, provides acceptance and understanding to you.
Self - Selves
Individual - Individuality
Universal - Universality
Place your entire life in a container </description>
