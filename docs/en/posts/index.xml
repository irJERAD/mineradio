        <description>War Between Worlds When imagining a great galactic battle. One between civilizations.
When disparate worlds engage in conflict there is room for many misplaced assumptions and under calculated outcomes to really affect the outcome of the events.
/Particularly with regard to how things are handled afterwards./
Countries go to war and afterwards countries still stand.
When worlds go to war wont worlds both still stand?
Consequences compared with winner take all expectations.</description>

        <description>All these faces are lies Not letting people use my face. They are horrible.
I never made an agreement with anyone that was not written down by hand as well.
I never agreed to allow people to use my face, an image of my face, or any likeness of my face in their memories or their lives.
Wait, Is This Real? I keep asking for someone to talk about this with so I can accept and handle this being real.</description>

        <description>Wednesday night, January 15 around 4:30pm I was watching a cloud strum show put on by The Game Master, The Pirate Ship, Astronaughts, The Dream Liner, and the Black Whole New World. Toward the end I saw a family of four come out in the eye of a giant moving statue. The Father Mother and two children, Daughter&#39;s around 8 wearing a tuo-tuo and around 12. All posed and asked me to take a photograph - they called to me by name.</description>

        <description>Late December I was working on this site and uploaded this photo. The picture spoke to me and I received a message. I assumed the message was meant to reach me in June because that is when the photo was taken. About the same time, Stephanie went to Morea and came home with electric teeth. Just over a year ago while I was in New Zealand Stephanie went to Morea and took a photo.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Don&#39;t drink from the black liquid.&amp;rdquo; - They say.
&amp;ldquo;Your heart is new, your debt in paid.&amp;rdquo;
They have said this before.
It is always the same; however,
I do feel well, and I love myself.
I truly love who I am,
and there is something else.
No magic was taken, not a breadth or 4 or 5.
And although the ones above care not what I put inside,
only that I am cared for as I&#39;ll reach potential, it is in my design.</description>

        <description>Bee’s, we can save the bees!
Would that be so amazing?
With so much going on in the world and so many concerned about change and disaster around tomorrows dawn.
We could actually be some of the people who got to help the future hero’s world.
Uncertain climate, certain regional population growth and collapse, risky food supply, lack of proper safe clean power, and all participating in a larger shake in the tidal rhythms of economic ether.</description>

        <description>Staring intently out the window changing my focus to try and make out something where there was clearly nothing there. It was the end of a game night and still dark which meant we had finished up early. I had stood their staring out my window at the same tree-framed garden scape, when three Tanuki appeared standing infront. They must have been floating around 3 feet off of the ground. There 5 and a half foot tall body put them at about head high length with my 2 foot elevated floor.</description>

        <description>Do This at least once a day and every night before you go to bed.
Anytime you feel as though your reach extends beyond your gasp,
And you are not comfortable with how the world feels around you;
This exercise will bring your energy to a familiar level you are comfortable with
Walkout hold together.
Take yourself where you intend to be received.
Give the earth your radical excess.
Ground yourself Feet planted</description>

        <description>HCI intro We are eager to take our interaction with technology and each other to the next level.
Screens changed the way we consume information.
The keyboard expedited the speed at which we could input data.

Here we have leveraged rich contextual and cultural &amp;hellip;
Mouse Metaphor Now we can propose to complete relieve ourselves of the tangible constraints to our processing platforms we just recently prized (throws mouse over shoulder: the two-axis mouse limits us to up, down and side to side inputs with our screen to navigate to a file.</description>

        <description>Part of: Why I am special
May 24 or 26 dates and times matched with earth quake in peru I think (fake internet?)
So much carry on. But needed to get the words down for a second time. The first time I wrote this by hand it seemed to convince my most powerful opponents to wait rather than cut me from the story.

This happened right after the grocery store when I felt a huge shift.</description>

        <description>Daniel is professional in a militant fashion. Determined to complete the objective in the face of unsurmountable insufficiency.
Phil is punctual with a poignaint complusion for order. Seeking not only the respect of this order but also the dominance of it.
The order Daniel serves is one he wishes to preech. He is not one to preech down to; however he will preech at for a lack of base line level of effective action.</description>

        <description>Oh Look We&#39;ve Done Less than three years ago I was in a bad place and had not realized it yet. I had no job and was in the first year of a two year campaign targeted at arresting my life with my family, friends, wife and career. He cannot afford you: I could not afford my wife. My cost of living could no longer be bottom lined with cup of noodles, bus passes, and offloading as much extra cost and time to my parents, such as laundry and dinner, as possible.</description>

Self - Selves
Individual - Individuality
Universal - Universality
