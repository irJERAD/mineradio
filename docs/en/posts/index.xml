        <description>Metaphor: The human soul is like a film Born completely empty of anything worldly, no light has touched the surface of the film up to the moment of birth. This is a new soul; a blank film. Etched over a lifetime as experience, activity, and mindset this film would walk you through a person in their entirety. Familiar aspects to be found printed along a soul would be:
 Personality and disposition mostly inferred from other aspects found recorded on the film Emotional decisions and their process Activities, Planned Excursions Dreams, Day Dreams, Wishes Plans lived through in your mind but not carried out to execution  Dimensionality / Time Beware: The photograph captures your soul Some native american&#39;s believed the photograph captured their soul.</description>

        <description>Big Bag to Big Freeze As our universe presses on past 13.5 billion years, age gets the best of it. The ever accelerating expansion, dark energy and dark matter press us toward a big freeze.
Eventually, the growing source behind the force that visibly expands our galaxy apart from each other will press and press at our atomic particles until they can no longer maintain the structure we require for life and the physical universe as we know it.</description>

        <description>Staring intently out the window changing my focus to try and make out something where there was clearly nothing there. It was the end of a game night and still dark which meant we had finished up early. I had stood their staring out my window at the same tree-framed garden scape, when three Tanuki appeared standing infront. They must have been floating around 3 feet off of the ground. There 5 and a half foot tall body put them at about head high length with my 2 foot elevated floor.</description>

With the mouse and GUI&#39;s human interaction with our computers entered the skeuomorphic era.
Here we have leveraged rich contextual and cultural &amp;hellip;
Mouse Metaphor Now we can propose to complete relieve ourselves of the tangible constraints to our processing platforms we just recently prized (throws mouse over shoulder: the two-axis mouse limits us to up, down and side to side inputs with our screen to navigate to a file.</description>

        <description>Part of: Why I am special
May 24 or 26 dates and times matched with earth quake in peru I think (fake internet?)

This happened right after the grocery store when I felt a huge shift.</description>

        <description>Oh Look We&#39;ve Done Less than three years ago I was in a bad place and had not realized it yet. I had no job and was in the first year of a two year campaign targeted at arresting my life with my family, friends, wife and career. He cannot afford you: I could not afford my wife. My cost of living could no longer be bottom lined with cup of noodles, bus passes, and offloading as much extra cost and time to my parents, such as laundry and dinner, as possible.</description>

        <description>Why Can&#39;t We All Just Get Along Practices for us to better life together. As once one, now many, we are always from each other. Some may say our best selves are in each other. What makes you, you, brings ability and capacity to us all. What makes us, us, provides acceptance and understanding to you.
Self - Selves
Individual - Individuality
Universal - Universality
Place your entire life in a container </description>
